# Contributing to Windows Driver Documentation

This page covers the basic steps for contributing to the Windows driver documentation.

There's also an [introductory video](https://channel9.msdn.com/Blogs/WinHEC/Contributing-to-MSDN-and-TechNet-Documentation) that shows you how to propose changes.

## Sign a CLA

If you want to contribute more than a couple lines and you're not a Microsoft employee, you need to [sign a Microsoft Contribution Licensing Agreement (CLA)](https://cla.microsoft.com/).

If you are a Microsoft employee, be sure to [link your GitHub account and alias](https://opensource.microsoft.com/link).

If you've already contributed to Microsoft repositories in the past, congratulations! You've already completed this step.

## Proposing a change

If you'd like to suggest a change to the docs, follow these steps:

1. While viewing a published article in [Windows hardware developer documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/), click the **Edit** button in the upper right of the page.  You will be redirected to the corresponding Markdown source file in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/windows-driver-docs).  If you're already in the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/windows-driver-docs), you can just navigate to the source file you would like to change.
2. If you don't already have a GitHub account, click **Sign Up** in the upper right and create a new account.
3. From the GitHub page you would like to change, click the pencil icon.
4. Modify the file and use the preview tab to ensure the changes look good.
5. When you're done, commit your changes and open a pull request.

After you create the pull request, a member of the Windows Driver Documentation team will review your changes.

If your request is accepted, updates are published to [Windows hardware developer documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers).

## Making more substantial changes

To make substantial changes to an existing article, add or change images, or contribute a new article, we recommend forking the official repo into your GitHub account, and then creating a local clone. For more info, see [Fork a Repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/).

## Using issues to provide feedback on Windows driver documentation

If you would like to provide feedback rather than suggesting a change to documentation, [create an issue](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/windows-driver-docs/issues).

Be sure to include the topic title and the URL for the page.
