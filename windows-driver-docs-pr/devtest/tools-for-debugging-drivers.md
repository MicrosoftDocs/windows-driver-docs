# Tools for Debugging Drivers


## <span id="ddk_tools_for_debugging_drivers_tools"></span><span id="DDK_TOOLS_FOR_DEBUGGING_DRIVERS_TOOLS"></span>


This section includes:

[Using Debugging Code in a Driver](using-debugging-code-in-a-driver.md)

[Using a Debugger](using-a-debugger.md)

**Note**  The Windows Driver Kit (WDK) 8 includes additional debugging tools: WSDDebug\_client.exe and WSDDebug\_host.exe. If you open a Visual Studio Command Prompt window, you can find these tools in the %WindowsSdkDir%\\bin\\*&lt;arch&gt;* directory. (These tools are also included in the Microsoft Windows SDK.)
These tools are a soft device and client that you can use to troubleshoot devices or applications. For more information about WSDDebug\_client and WSDDebug\_host, see the [Web Services on Devices](/windows/win32/wsdapi/wsd-portal) section of the Windows SDK.
