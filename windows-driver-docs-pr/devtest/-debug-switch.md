# /Debug Switch


The /**Debug** switch of the Enhanced Storage Certificate Management tool reports on the capabilities and information about the authentication silo certificate (ASC) store in an IEEE 1667-compliant USB storage device. This report includes the following parts:

-   The algorithms that are used for hashing and signing.

-   The total number of certificate slots.

-   The number of occupied and empty certificate slots.

**Note**  In this topic, the specified IEEE 1667-compliant USB storage device is referred to as the *target device*.



```
    EhStorCertMgrCmd /Debug -Volume:
    VolumeName
```

<span id="_______-Volume_______"></span><span id="_______-volume_______"></span><span id="_______-VOLUME_______"></span> **-Volume:**   
The volume name of the target device. For more information about the format of this parameter, see [Overview of the Enhanced Storage Certificate Management Tool](overview-of-the-enhanced-storage-certificate-management-tool.md).

**Note**  To produce a list of the volume names of the IEEE 1667-compliant USB storage devices that are currently connected to a computer, enter **EhStorCertMgrCmd /List** from the command-line.
