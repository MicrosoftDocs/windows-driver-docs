<li>There is an assignment of NULL that is dereferenced later.</li>
<li>There is a global/parameter to a procedure in a driver that may be NULL that is dereferenced later, and there is an explicit check in the driver that suggests that the initial value of the pointer may be NULL.</li>

**To select the DDI usage rule set**

1.  Select your driver project (.vcxProj) in Microsoft Visual Studio. From the **Driver** menu, click **Launch Static Driver Verifier…**.

2.  Click the **Rules** tab. Under **Rule Sets**, select **DDIUsage**.

    To select the default rule set from a Visual Studio developer command prompt window, specify **DDIUsage.sdv** with the **/check** option. For example:

    ```
    msbuild /t:sdv /p:Inputs="/check:DDIUsage.sdv" mydriver.VcxProj /p:Configuration="Win8 Release" /p:Platform=Win32
    ```
