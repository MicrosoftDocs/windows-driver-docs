# Selecting Driver Verifier Options


## <span id="ddk_selecting_driver_verifier_options_tools"></span><span id="DDK_SELECTING_DRIVER_VERIFIER_OPTIONS_TOOLS"></span>


Driver Verifier options can be selected by using the [**Verifier Command Line**](verifier-command-line.md), or by using [Driver Verifier Manager](driver-verifier-manager--windows-xp-and-later-.md).

### <span id="verifier_command_line"></span><span id="VERIFIER_COMMAND_LINE"></span>Verifier Command Line

To activate or deactivate individual options, specify the desired options after the **/flags** parameter.

(Windows XP and later) To activate the standard options -- [Special Pool](special-pool.md), [Force IRQL Checking](force-irql-checking.md), [Pool Tracking](pool-tracking.md), [I/O Verification](i-o-verification.md), [DMA Verification](dma-verification.md), and [Deadlock Detection](deadlock-detection.md) -- use the **/standard** parameter. Starting with Windows Vista, the standard options also include [Security Checks](security-checks.md) and [Miscellaneous Checks](miscellaneous-checks.md). Starting with Windows 8, the standard options also include [DDI compliance checking](ddi-compliance-checking.md).

To deactivate all options and clear the verified driver list, use the **/reset** parameter.

See [**Verifier Command Line**](verifier-command-line.md) for details.

Driver Verifier Manager can select options in a variety of ways:

-   To control exactly which options are active, select the **Create custom settings** task and press **Next**. On the next screen, select **Select individual settings from a full list**, and press **Next**. The next screen lists all of Driver Verifier's options. Starting with Windows Vista, the options also include [Security Checks](security-checks.md) and [Miscellaneous Checks](miscellaneous-checks.md). Starting with Windows 8, the options also include [Power Framework Delay Fuzzing](concurrency-stress-test.md), [DDI compliance checking](ddi-compliance-checking.md), [Invariant MDL Checking for Stack](invariant-mdl-checking-for-stack.md), and [Invariant MDL Checking for Driver](invariant-mdl-checking-for-driver.md). Starting with Windows 8.1, the options also include [NDIS/WIFI verification](ndis-wifi-verification.md), [Kernel synchronization delay fuzzing](kernel-synchronization-delay-fuzzing.md), [VM switch verification](vm-switch-verification.md), and [Systematic low resources simulation](systematic-low-resource-simulation.md). Check whichever options you wish to activate.

-   To choose from predefined sets of options, select the **Create custom settings** task and press **Next**. On the next screen, select **Enable predefined settings** and select any of the check boxes. Selecting the **Standard settings** enables Special Pool, Force IRQL Checking, Pool Tracking, I/O Verification, DMA Verification, and Deadlock Detection. Starting with Windows Vista, selecting the standard options also enables [Security Checks](security-checks.md) and [Miscellaneous Checks](miscellaneous-checks.md). Starting with Windows 8, selecting the standard options also enables [DDI compliance checking](ddi-compliance-checking.md). Selecting the **Low resource simulation** check box enables Low Resources Simulation. Selecting the **Enhanced I/O Verification** check box enables Enhanced I/O Verification. 

-   To choose the standard options, select the **Create standard settings** task. The standard settings include Special Pool, Force IRQL Checking, Pool Tracking, I/O Verification, DMA Verification, and Deadlock Detection. Starting with Windows Vista, the standard settings also include [Security Checks](security-checks.md) and [Miscellaneous Checks](miscellaneous-checks.md). Starting with Windows 8, the standard settings also include [DDI compliance checking](ddi-compliance-checking.md).

Note that starting with Windows Vista, if the **Low resources simulation** check box is selected using either of the first two methods listed above, the next screen is the screen for setting the Probability, Applications, Pool Tags, and System Start Delay Time options for Low Resources Simulation. Set these options to the desired values.

When you have completed one of these steps, press **Next**. See [Selecting Drivers to be Verified](selecting-drivers-to-be-verified.md) for the next step.

To deactivate all options and clear the verified driver list, select the **Delete existing settings** task. Then press **Finish**.

### <span id="reboot_required"></span><span id="REBOOT_REQUIRED"></span>Reboot Required

Beginning in Windows Vista, you can activate and deactivate all options without restarting ("rebooting") the computer except for [DDI compliance checking](ddi-compliance-checking.md), [Power Framework Delay Fuzzing](concurrency-stress-test.md), or [Storport Verification](dv-storport-verification.md).
