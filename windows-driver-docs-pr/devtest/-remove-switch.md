# /Remove Switch


The **/Remove** switch of the Enhanced Storage Certificate Management tool removes a specified certificate from the authentication silo certificate (ASC) store in an IEEE 1667-compliant USB storage device.

**Note**  To produce a list of the volume names of the IEEE 1667-compliant USB storage devices that are currently connected to a computer, type **EhStorCertMgrCmd /List** at the command prompt and then press Enter.



```
    EhStorCertMgrCmd /Remove  -Volume:
    VolumeName
     -Index:
    IndexValue
```

<span id="_______-Volume_______"></span><span id="_______-volume_______"></span><span id="_______-VOLUME_______"></span> **-Volume:**   
The volume name of the target device. For more information about the format of this parameter, see [Overview of the Enhanced Storage Certificate Management Tool](overview-of-the-enhanced-storage-certificate-management-tool.md).

**Note**  To produce a list of the volume names of the IEEE 1667-compliant USB storage devices that are currently connected to a computer, type **EhStorCertMgrCmd /List** at the command prompt and then press Enter.



<span id="_______-Index_______"></span><span id="_______-index_______"></span><span id="_______-INDEX_______"></span> **-Index:**   
The index within the ASC store where the certificate will be removed. The index value must be greater than one.

### <span id="comments"></span><span id="COMMENTS"></span>Comments

The **/Remove** switch removes all certificates from the target device except for following certificates:

-   The provisioning certificate (PCp). To remove the PCp certificate, you must use the [**/Initialize switch**](-initialize-switch.md).

-   The ASC-manufacturer certificate (ASCm).

    **Note**   The Enhanced Storage Certificate Management tool cannot add, remove, or replace the ASC-manufacturer (ASCm) certificate from the ASC store in the target device.



To remove certificates from the target device, the device must have been provisioned with a PCp certificate, and the private key of that certificate must reside in the host so that it can pass administrative authentication with the device.

If you remove an ASC-host certificate (ASCh), the tool removes all related signer certificates (SCh) in the ASCh certificate chain.

If you remove a SCh certificate from an ASCh certificate chain, the tool removes the specified SCh certificate together with its entire parent SCh certificates in the certificate chain.

The following example shows how to remove the certificate at index two within the ASC store of a target device:

```
EhStorCertMgrCmd /Remove -Volume:"\\?\usbstor#ieee1667control&ven_&prod_&rev_#123456789&0&control#{4f40006f-b933-4550-b532-2b58cee614d3}" -Index:2
