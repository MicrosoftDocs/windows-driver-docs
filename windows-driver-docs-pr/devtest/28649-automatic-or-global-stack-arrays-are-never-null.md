warning C28649: Automatic or Global Stack Arrays are never NULL

Stack-based arrays can never be **NULL**. However, most of the time the intention is to check a particular element (mostly the first element) against **NULL** or for a **null** character. Due to an error of omission, the programmer misses the dereferencing (\*) operator that results in the array being checked instead.
