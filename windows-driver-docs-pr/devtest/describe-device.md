# Describe the device in the Device Metadata Authoring Wizard

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Device metadata is deprecated and will be removed in a future release of Windows. For information about the replacement for this functionality, see **[Driver Package Container Metadata](../install/driver-package-container-metadata.md)**.

Windows displays descriptive information that you provide about a device, such as the model name and manufacturer.

## To provide descriptive information about a device

1. Click the **Description** tab.
1. Fill out the following fields:
    - **Model Name**. Model name of the device (required)
    - **Manufacturer**. Name of the device manufacturer (required)
    - **Model number**. Model number of the device (optional)
    - **Description 1**. Descriptive text (optional)
    - **Description 2**. Additional descriptive text (optional)

If you selected **Multiple Locales** in the **Package Definition** tab, you see multiple **Locale** tabs. Click each tab to define the information for all locales. If you don't complete the required fields in each locale tab, you receive an error message when you click the **Finish** button on the **Finish** tab.
