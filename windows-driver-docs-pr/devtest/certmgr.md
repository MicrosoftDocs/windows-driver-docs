# CertMgr


CertMgr (Certmgr.exe) is a command-line [CryptoAPI](/windows/win32/seccrypto/cryptography-portal) tool that manages certificates, certificate trust lists (CTLs), and certificate revocation lists (CRLs).

CertMgr supports a large number of switches, but this section describes only those that are relevant to managing [test certificates](../install/makecert-test-certificate.md) within a certificate store.

```
    CertMgr [/add|/del|/put] [Switches] [/s [/r RegistryLocation ] ] SourceName [/s [/r RegistryLocation] ] [DestinationName]
```

<span id="_r_registryLocation"></span><span id="_r_registrylocation"></span><span id="_R_REGISTRYLOCATION"></span>**/r** *registryLocation*  
Specifies the registry location of the system certificate store. The **/r** switch is only valid when used with the **/s** switch. The *registryLocation* argument must be either:

<span id="currentUser"></span><span id="currentuser"></span><span id="CURRENTUSER"></span>*currentUser*  
Specifies the registry location HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER.

<span id="localMachine"></span><span id="localmachine"></span><span id="LOCALMACHINE"></span>*localMachine*  
Specifies the registry location HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE.

If the **/r** switch is not specified along with the **/s** switch, *currentUser* is the default.

For more information about these certificate stores, see [Certificate Stores](../install/certificate-stores.md).

<span id="_v"></span><span id="_V"></span>**/v**  
Configures CertMgr to display detailed information about certificates, CTLs, and CRLs. If this switch is not specified, CertMgr only displays brief information.

### <span id="comments"></span><span id="COMMENTS"></span>Comments

To use CertMgr, the user must be a member of the Administrators group on the system and run the command from an elevated command prompt.

For a complete list of CertMgr parameters, see the [Certificate Manager Tool](/dotnet/framework/tools/certmgr-exe-certificate-manager-tool) website.

A 32-bit version of the CertMgr tool is located in the *bin\\i386* folder of the WDK. A 64-bit version of the tool is located in the bin\\amd64 and bin\\ia64 folders of the WDK.

```
