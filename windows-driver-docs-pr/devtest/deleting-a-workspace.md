# Deleting a Workspace


When you delete a workspace, you delete all of the saved trace session properties and configuration settings from TraceView.

For information about stopping a workspace session or removing it from the display, see [Stopping and Removing a Workspace Session](stopping-and-removing-a-workspace-session.md).
