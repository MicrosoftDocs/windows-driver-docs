# Importing Certificates from a Windows Certificate Store


You can use the Enhanced Storage Certificate Management tool to import certificates from your private certificate store in the computer to an IEEE 1667-compliant USB storage device.

To import a certificate from a private certificate store, you must specify the certificate name by using the **-Store** parameter of the [**/Add**](enhstor-add-switch.md) and [**/Replace**](-replace-switch.md) switches of the Enhanced Storage Certificate Management tool. The tool searches all of your private certificate stores for the specified certificate and (if found) imports it to a specified USB storage device.

**Note**  The tool does not import a certificate from the Windows root certificate store.
