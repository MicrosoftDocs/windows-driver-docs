warning C28740: Unannotated unsigned buffer

This warning indicates that a buffer passed as a function parameter or returned by a function should be annotated with the Microsoft Source Code Annotation language (SAL). Static analysis tools can use such annotations to detect buffer overruns.

Currently, only non-constant buffers are diagnosed with this warning.

## <span id="Example"></span><span id="example"></span><span id="EXAMPLE"></span>Example


The following code example generates this warning.

```
    int foo( BYTE * buffer, size_t cch ); 
```

The following code example avoids this warning by using the SAL annotation **\_Out\_writes\_** to specify that the called function writes to the buffer and that the buffer cannot be NULL. The annotation indicates that the buffer is of *cch* elements.

```
    int foo( _Out_writes_(cch) BYTE * buffer, size_t cch );
```
