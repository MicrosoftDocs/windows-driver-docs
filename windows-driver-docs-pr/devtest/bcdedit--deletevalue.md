# BCDEdit /deletevalue

The **BCDEdit /deletevalue** command deletes or removes a boot entry option (and its value) from the Windows boot configuration data store (BCD). Use the **BCDEdit /deletevalue** command to remove options that were added using the [**BCDEdit /set**](bcdedit--set.md) command.

``` syntax
bcdedit  /deletevalue [{ID}] datatype  
```

> [!NOTE]
> Before deleting BCDEdit options you might need to disable or suspend BitLocker and Secure Boot on the computer.

To delete a boot option value that you have set, use the **BCDEdit /deletevalue** command. A common scenario for using the **BCDEdit /deletevalue** command is to remove boot entry options when you are testing and debugging a driver. 

For example, if you use [**BCDEdit /set**](bcdedit--set.md) to change the **groupsize** processor group option to a new value for testing purposes, you can use **BCDEdit /deletevalue** to delete the new value and revert to the default value by typing the following command. Note that you must then restart the computer for the change to take effect.

``` syntax
bcdedit /deletevalue groupsize
```
