# CompleteCanceledReq rule (kmdf)


The **CompleteCanceledReq** rule specifies that if the request has already been canceled, the request is no longer valid, and the driver should not complete it. While the driver unmarks a request that was previously marked cancelable, it must check that the request has not already been canceled. If the driver does not make this check, the driver might complete a request that has been freed.

**Driver model: KMDF**
