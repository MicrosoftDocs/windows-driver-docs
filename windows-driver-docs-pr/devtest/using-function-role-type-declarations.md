# Using Function Role Type Declarations


SDV requires that the functions be declared using function role type declarations.

The function role types, which are predefined typedefs that you use in function declarations, identify the distinct roles that are defined for event callback functions in the underlying KMDF driver model or dispatch functions in the underlying WDM driver model, or for the different callback functions in the NDIS or Storport driver models. The function role type declarations replace traditional declarations for these functions.

For more information about adding these declarations, see the following.
