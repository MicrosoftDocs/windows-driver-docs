# WPP Software Tracing


This section describes how to use the *Windows software trace preprocessor* (WPP) to trace the operation of a software component ([trace provider](trace-provider.md)). A trace provider can be one of the following:

-   A kernel-mode driver.

-   A user-mode driver, application, or dynamic-link library (DLL).

WPP software tracing supplements and enhances [WMI event tracing](../kernel/wmi-event-tracing.md) by adding ways to simplify tracing the operation of the trace provider. It is an efficient mechanism for the trace provider to log real-time binary messages. The logged messages can subsequently be converted to a human-readable trace of the operation of the trace provider.

Logging messages with WPP software tracing is similar to using Windows event logging services. The driver logs a message ID and unformatted binary data in a log file. Subsequently, a postprocessor converts the information in the log file to a human-readable form. However, WPP software tracing supports message formats that are more capable and flexible than that supported by the event logging services. For example, WPP software tracing has built-in support for IP addresses, GUIDs, system IDs, time stamps, and other useful data types. In addition, users can add custom data types relevant to their application.

### An overview of the WPP software tracing process

The basic process for adding WPP software tracing to a driver or application, includes the following steps. If you use one of the Visual Studio templates provided in the WDK for creating a WDF driver, much of the work is done for you.

-   Define a control GUID that uniquely identifies the driver or application as a [trace provider](trace-provider.md). The provider specifies this GUID in its definition of the [WPP\_CONTROL\_GUIDS](/previous-versions/windows/hardware/previsioning-framework/ff556186(v=vs.85)) macro and in a related control file used by [Tracelog](tracelog.md) or another [Trace Controller](trace-controller.md).

-   Add the required WPP-related C preprocessor directives and WPP macro calls to the provider's source files, as described in [Adding WPP Software Tracing to a Windows Driver](adding-wpp-software-tracing-to-a-windows-driver.md) and in [WPP Software Tracing Reference](/previous-versions/windows/hardware/previsioning-framework/ff556205(v=vs.85)).

-   Modify the Visual Studio project to run the WPP preprocessor and build the driver, as described in [Step 6](adding-wpp-software-tracing-to-a-windows-driver.md#step-6-modify-the-visual-studio-project-to-run-the-wpp-preprocessor-and-build-the-solution) of Adding WPP Software Tracing to a Windows Driver. You can refer to the [WPP Preprocessor](wpp-preprocessor.md) for more build time options.

-   Install the driver or component. Start a trace session and record the trace messages. Use the tools for software tracing, such as [TraceView](traceview.md), [Tracelog](tracelog.md), [Tracefmt](tracefmt.md), and [Tracepdb](tracepdb.md) to configure, start, and stop tracing sessions and to display and filter trace messages. These tools are included in the Windows Driver Kit (WDK).

**Note**   Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) and WPP support most types of kernel-mode and user-mode drivers. However, ETW and WPP use types that are not available for certain types of drivers, such as miniport drivers. To determine whether a particular driver type is supported, add basic WPP macros to the driver, such as [WPP\_INIT\_TRACING](/previous-versions/windows/hardware/previsioning-framework/ff556191(v=vs.85)) and [WPP\_CLEANUP](/previous-versions/windows/hardware/previsioning-framework/ff556179(v=vs.85)). If the code does not compile because the types that are used are not defined, ETW and WPP cannot support the driver type.

For more information about ETW, see [Event Tracing for Windows](/windows-hardware/test/wpt/event-tracing-for-windows).

**Note** WPP trace providers can only be enabled by one trace session at a time. See [WPP Providers](/windows/desktop/ETW/about-event-tracing#providers) for more information.
