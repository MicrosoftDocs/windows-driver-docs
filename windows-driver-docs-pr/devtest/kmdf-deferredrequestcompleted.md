title: DeferredRequestCompleted Rule (KMDF)
description: The DeferredRequestCompleted rule specifies that if an I/O request presented to a driver's default I/O queue is not completed in the callback function but is deferred for later processing, the request must be completed in a deferred processing callback function, unless the request is forwarded and delivered to the framework, or unless the WdfRequestStopAcknowledge method is called.

# DeferredRequestCompleted rule (kmdf)


The **DeferredRequestCompleted** rule specifies that if an I/O request presented to a driver's default I/O queue is not completed in the callback function but is deferred for later processing, the request must be completed in a deferred processing callback function, unless the request is forwarded and delivered to the framework, or unless the [**WdfRequestStopAcknowledge**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdfrequest/nf-wdfrequest-wdfrequeststopacknowledge) method is called.

The **DeferredRequestCompleted** rule requires that you identify the deferred requests using the **\_\_sdv\_save\_request** and **\_\_sdv\_retrieve\_request** macros. For information about how to use these macros, see [Using \_\_sdv\_save\_request and \_\_sdv\_retrieve\_request for Deferred Procedure Calls](./using---sdv-save-request-and---sdv-retrieve-request-for-deferred-proce.md). The precondition rule **AliasWithinTimerDpc** checks for the presence of these macros.

A request presented to the driver's default queue through one of the queue callback functions and deferred, must be completed before it exits from the I/O request callback functions, except in the following cases:

-   The I/O request was forwarded to an I/O target or to another queue

-   The I/O request was delivered to the framework (by calling [**WdfDeviceEnqueueRequest**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdfdevice/nf-wdfdevice-wdfdeviceenqueuerequest))

-   The **WdfRequestStopAcknowledge** method was called

The rule is verified when the driver exits from the following callback functions:

-   **EvtIoStop**, **EvtCleanupCallback** or **EvtDestroyCallback** for the queue

-   **EvtCleanupCallback** or **EvtDestroyCallback** for the file object

-   **EvtFileClose**, **EvtFileCleanup**, **EvtDeviceSelfManagedIoSuspend**, **EvtDeviceSelfManagedIoFlush**, **EvtDeviceSelfManagedIoCleanup**, **EvtDeviceShutdownNotification**, **EvtDeviceSurpriseRemoval**, **EvtCleanupCallback** or **EvtDestroyCallback** for the device

-   **EvtDriverUnload**

The I/O queue callback functions for the I/O request presentation are **EvtIoDefault**, **EvtIoRead**, **EvtIoWrite**, **EvtIoDeviceControl**, and **EvtIoInternalDeviceControl**.

The deferred processing callback functions for an I/O request are **EvtTimerFunc**, **EvtDpcFunc**, **EvtInterruptDpc**, **EvtInterruptEnable**, **EvtInterruptDisable**, and **EvtWorkItem**.

The **DeferredRequestCompleted** rule uses calls to the **WdfRequestMarkCancelable**, **WdfDmaTransactionInitializeUsingRequest**, **WdfDmaTransactionInitialize**, or **WdfWorkItemEnqueue** methods to indicate that the I/O request is being deferred.
