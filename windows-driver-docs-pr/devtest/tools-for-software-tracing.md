# Tools for Software Tracing


The Microsoft Windows Driver Kit (WDK) includes a set of applications and command-line tools for software tracing. These tools are designed to support Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) and to supplement the tracing tools that are included in Windows.

- [What's in this section](#whats-in-this-section)

## What are the tracing tools?

The tools include [trace controllers](trace-controller.md) that configure, start, update, and stop trace sessions, and [trace consumers](trace-consumer.md) that receive trace messages generated during the sessions and convert the binary data into human-readable format for files or display.

The tools support a variety of [trace providers](trace-provider.md), including user-mode applications and kernel-mode drivers, which are instrumented for software tracing by using [WPP software tracing](wpp-software-tracing.md) or [Event Tracing for Windows (ETW)](event-tracing-for-windows--etw-.md). For a comparison of the two approaches to instrumenting your code, see [When to Use WPP Software Tracing and Event Tracing for Windows (ETW)](#when-should-i-use-wpp-software-tracing-or-the-event-tracing-for-windows-etw-api).

The tools also can access reserved [trace sessions](trace-session.md) that are built into Windows, such as the [Global Logger trace session](global-logger-trace-session.md) / [NT Kernel Logger trace session](nt-kernel-logger-trace-session.md).

Some of these tools are located in the tools\\&lt;*Platform*&gt; subdirectory of the Windows Driver Kit (WDK), where &lt;*Platform*&gt; is either x86 or x64. Other tools are either included with Windows or are located in the bin\\&lt;*Platform*&gt; subdirectory of the WDK.

## When should I use WPP Software Tracing or the Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) API?

Use [WPP Software Tracing](wpp-software-tracing.md) if you are interested in primarily collecting trace data for development and debugging purposes. Use [Event Tracing for Windows (ETW)](event-tracing-for-windows--etw-.md) for other types of tracing.

For information about using Windows software trace preprocessor (WPP) macros to add software tracing to a driver or application, see [WPP Software Tracing](wpp-software-tracing.md).

For information about the using the kernel-mode ETW API for drivers, see [Event Tracing for Windows (ETW)](event-tracing-for-windows--etw-.md).

For information about using the Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) extensions to the Windows Driver Model (WDM) to add software tracing to any driver, see [WMI Event Tracing](../kernel/wmi-event-tracing.md).

**Note**   ETW and WPP support most types of kernel-mode drivers and user-mode applications. However, ETW and WPP use types that are not available for certain types of drivers, such as miniport drivers. To determine whether a particular driver type is supported, add basic WPP macros to the driver, such as [WPP\_INIT\_TRACING](/previous-versions/windows/hardware/previsioning-framework/ff556191(v=vs.85)) and [WPP\_CLEANUP](/previous-versions/windows/hardware/previsioning-framework/ff556179(v=vs.85)). If the code does not compile because the types that are used are not defined, then ETW and WPP cannot support the driver type.
