# Using the Device Metadata Authoring Wizard

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Device metadata is deprecated and will be removed in a future release of Windows. For information about the replacement for this functionality, see **[Driver Package Container Metadata](../install/driver-package-container-metadata.md)**.

This topic describes the Device Metadata Authoring tool provided in the Windows Driver Kit (WDK) 8.

## Getting started

After you launch the **Authoring** tool, the **Welcome to the Metadata Authoring Wizard** screen appears. Select one of the following options:

- To create a new device metadata package, select **Create new device metadata package**, and then click **Next**.
- To update an existing device metadata package, select **Update existing device metadata package**, click **Browse** to select the package, and then click **Next**.

> [!NOTE]
> You can't edit Device Stage experiences with the tool. However, the Device Stage folder isn't changed if you update the package by using this tool.
