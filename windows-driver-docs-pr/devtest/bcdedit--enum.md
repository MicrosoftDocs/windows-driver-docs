# BCDEdit /enum


The **BCDEdit /enum** command lists entries in Boot Configuration Data (BCD) store. The /enum command is the default,
so running "bcdedit" without parameters is equivalent to running "bcdedit /enum ACTIVE".

```syntax
bcdedit [/store <filename>] /enum [<type> | <id>] [/v]
```

> [!CAUTION]
>Administrative privileges are required to use BCDEdit to view the BCD store. Changing some boot entry options using the BCDEdit /set command could render your computer inoperable. As an alternative, use the System Configuration utility (MSConfig.exe) to change boot settings. For more information, see *[How to open MSConfig in Windows 10](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4026130/windows-how-to-open-msconfig-in-windows-10)*.

## Parameters

**\<filename\>**

Specifies the store to be used. If this option is not specified, the system store is used. For more information, run "bcdedit /? store".

**\<type\>**

Specifies the type of entries to be listed. Can be one of the following:

*ACTIVE* - All entries in the boot manager display order. This is the default.

*FIRMWARE* - All firmware applications.

*BOOTAPP* - All boot environment applications.

*BOOTMGR* - The boot manager.

*OSLOADER* - All operating system entries.

*RESUME* - All resume from hibernation entries.

*INHERIT* - All inherit entries.

*ALL* - All entries.

**\<id\>**

Specifies the identifier of the entry to be listed.  If an identifier is provided, then only the specified object will be
listed. For information about identifiers, run "bcdedit /? ID".

**/v**

Displays entry identifiers in full, rather than using names for well-known identifiers.
