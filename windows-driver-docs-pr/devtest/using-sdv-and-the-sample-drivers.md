# Using SDV and the Sample Drivers


To help you get started using Static Driver Verifier (SDV) you can run the tool on the SDV-FailDriver samples. The sample drivers contain intentional code errors that are designed to show the capabilities and features of SDV. These sample drivers are not functional and are not intended as examples for real driver development projects. There are SDV-FailDriver sample drivers available in the [Windows driver samples](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-driver-samples) repository on GitHub.
