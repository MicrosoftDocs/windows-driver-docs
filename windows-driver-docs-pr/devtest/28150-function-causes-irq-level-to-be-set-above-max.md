The specified function has raised the IRQL above the maximum IRQL permitted for the current function call.

This warning occurs inside a function that has been annotated with the **\_\_drv\_maxIRQL** annotation and indicates either a coding error in the function or a misunderstanding of the function's contract in the annotations.
