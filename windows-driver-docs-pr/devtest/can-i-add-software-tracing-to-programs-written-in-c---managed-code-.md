# Can I add software tracing to programs written in C++ managed code?


Yes. Use the standard procedure for adding software tracing to the driver's source code. For more information, see [How do I initialize WPP software tracing in a kernel-mode driver?](how-do-i-initialize-wpp-software-tracing-in-a-kernel-mode-driver-.md).
