warning C28625: Function call used to clear sensitive data will be optimized away

The current function call might be optimized during compilation, which could make sensitive data stay in memory. Use the **SecureZeroMemory** or **RtlSecureZeroMemory** functions instead. A heuristic looks for identifier names that contain items such as "key" or "pass" to trigger this warning.
