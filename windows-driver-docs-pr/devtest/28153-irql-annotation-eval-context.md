This warning indicates that the Code Analysis tool cannot interpret the function annotation because the annotation is not coded correctly. As a result, the Code Analysis tool cannot determine the specified IRQL value.

This warning can occur with any of the driver-specific annotations that mention an IRQL when the Code Analysis tool cannot evaluate the expression for the IRQL.
