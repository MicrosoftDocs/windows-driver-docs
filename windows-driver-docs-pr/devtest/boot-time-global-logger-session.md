# Boot-Time Global Logger Session


You can create a Global Logger trace session that traces Windows kernel events during system boot. This method combines the features of the [NT Kernel Logger trace session](nt-kernel-logger-trace-session.md), which traces the kernel, with those of the [Global Logger trace session](global-logger-trace-session.md), which traces events that take place during system boot.

The procedure described in this section creates a Global Logger trace session, and then adds a special registry entry, **EnableKernelFlags**. The presence of the **EnableKernelFlags** entry, with a valid value, converts the Global Logger trace session to an NT Kernel Logger trace session. The valid values for **EnableKernelFlags** are taken from the values of the **EnableFlags** member of the [**EVENT\_TRACE\_PROPERTIES**](/windows/desktop/ETW/event-trace-properties) structure. The procedure is described in [How to Create a Boot-Time Global Logger Session](how-to-create-a-boot-time-global-logger-session.md).

Trace providers, including drivers, can log trace messages to this type of session. The procedure for doing so is described in [Logging to the Global Logger Session](logging-to-the-global-logger-session.md).
