The Verifier utility, Verifier.exe, activates and monitors Driver Verifier. This utility is located in the %windir%\\system32 directory of Windows.

There are two ways to use the Verifier utility. On Windows Vista and later versions of Windows, administrative privileges are required.

-   **Command line.** To use Driver Verifier at the command-line, open a Command Prompt window (**Run as administrator**), type **verifier** followed by at least one command-line parameter.

-   **Driver Verifier Manager.** To open the Driver Verifier Manager graphic user interface, open a Command Prompt window (**Run as administrator**), type **verifier** (with no parameters).

**Note**   Driver Verifier Manager in Windows XP and later differs slightly from the version of Driver Verifier Manager in Windows 2000.
