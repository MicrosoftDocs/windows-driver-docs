# Installing the Complete Checked Build

Probably the easiest way to use the checked build for debugging drivers is to install the complete checked build on your computer. Use the checked build distribution medium to install the checked build. This installs all available checked components on your computer.

This installation results in maximum debugging checks, but it also causes the system to run considerably slower than it would if the free build of the operating system were installed.
