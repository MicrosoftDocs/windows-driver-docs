# Creating Trace Session Groups


To create a trace session group:

1.  In the [Trace Session List](trace-session-list.md), select the sessions that you want to group. (You can use SHIFT+Click to select consecutive sessions and CTRL+Click to select non-consecutive sessions.)

2.  Right-click any cell in any selected session.

3.  Click **Group Sessions**.

The **Group Sessions** command is available only when the operating system supports grouping of that type of trace session. For details, see [Limitations of Grouping](limitations-of-grouping.md).
