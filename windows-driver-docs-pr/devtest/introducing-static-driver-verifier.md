# Introducing Static Driver Verifier


Static Driver Verifier (SDV) is a static verification tool that runs at compile time. It explores paths in the driver code by symbolically executing the source code, making the fewest possible assumptions about the state of the operating system and the initial state of the driver. As a result, SDV can exercise code in paths that are missed in traditional testing.

SDV includes a set of rules that define proper interaction between a driver and the operating system kernel. During verification, SDV examines every applicable branch of the driver code and the library code that it uses, and tries to prove that the driver violates the rules. If SDV fails to prove a violation, it reports that the driver complies with the rules and passes the verification.
