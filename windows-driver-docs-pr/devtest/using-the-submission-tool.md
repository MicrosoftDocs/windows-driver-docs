# Creating a device metadata submission package in Visual Studio


To create a device metadata submission package, use the Submission tool in Microsoft Visual Studio.

1.  In Visual Studio, click the **Driver** menu, select **Device Metadata**, and then select **Submission**.
2.  Click **Add Metadata Package**, select the package, and then click **Open**.
3.  Confirm the **Package Name** and **Model Name**, select **Preview** if you want to preview the package, and then click **Next** .
4.  Review the **Model Name**, **Hardware IDs**, and **Experience ID**.
5.  Next to **Experience Name**, type a name for the experience.
    **Note**  This step is required for all package submissions.

     

6.  Next to **Qualification**, select one of the following options from the list:
    -   **This device has an associated logo or unclassified submission**
        -   Enter **Logo Submission IDs**.
    -   **This device uses only inbox drivers and has no associated logo submissions**

7.  If the package has been submitted before, select **Update Experience**.
8.  Click **Next**.
9.  If you haven't signed your package, complete the following steps in the Signature Wizard to sign it:

    1.  Find your certificate file and double-click it to install it.
    2.  Make sure that you install the certificate file in the user store and not in the machine store.
    3.  Click **Launch Signature Wizard**.
    4.  Click **Select store**.
    5.  Select the certificate from the dialog box.
        **Note**   The file name in the Signature Wizard is what you receive after you complete the submission metadata wizard. Therefore, unless you have a specific reason, do not change the file name or path.

         

    6.  Complete the signing process.

10. When you're ready to submit your package, click **Launch Windows Dev Center - Hardware Dashboard**.
