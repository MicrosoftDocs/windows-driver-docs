> [!IMPORTANT]
> Windows Hardware Compatibility Program requires CodeQL for Static Tool Logo (STL) Tests on our Client and Server Operating Systems. We will continue to maintain support for SDV and CA on older products.  Partners are highly encouraged to review the CodeQL requirements for the [Static Tool Logo Test](/windows-hardware/test/hlk/testref/6ab6df93-423c-4af6-ad48-8ea1049155ae).
> For more information about using CodeQL, see [CodeQL and the Static Tools Logo Test](static-tools-and-codeql.md).
