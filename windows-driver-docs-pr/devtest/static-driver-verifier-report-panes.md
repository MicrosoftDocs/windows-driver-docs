# Static Driver Verifier Report Panes


The Static Driver Verifier Report consists of the following panes:

-   [Trace Tree pane](trace-tree-pane.md)

-   [Source Code pane](source-code-pane.md)

-   [State pane](state-pane.md)

Together, the **Trace Tree** pane, the **Source Code** pane, and the **State** pane form the [Defect Viewer](defect-viewer.md) window.

You can open the Defect Viewer only when SDV has detected a "defect" (rule violation).
