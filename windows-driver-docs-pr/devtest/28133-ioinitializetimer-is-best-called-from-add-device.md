The driver is calling [**IoInitializeTimer**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-ioinitializetimer) in a routine other than its **AddDevice** routine. The Code Analysis tool is using this opportunity to suggest a best practice recommendation that can prevent errors and make the driver code more reliable.
