# ReqDelete rule (kmdf)


The **ReqDelete** rule specifies that driver-created requests are not passed to *WdfRequestCompleteXxx* functions. Instead, the request should be deleted upon completion.

If the driver creates a framework request object in a call to [**WdfRequestCreate**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdfrequest/nf-wdfrequest-wdfrequestcreate), the request should be deleted by using [**WdfObjectDelete**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdfobject/nf-wdfobject-wdfobjectdelete) when the driver is finished with the request.

The driver cannot call [**WdfRequestComplete**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdfrequest/nf-wdfrequest-wdfrequestcomplete), [**WdfRequestCompleteWithInformation**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdfrequest/nf-wdfrequest-wdfrequestcompletewithinformation) or [**WdfRequestCompleteWithPriorityBoost**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdfrequest/nf-wdfrequest-wdfrequestcompletewithpriorityboost) functions on the request object. The *WdfRequestCompleteXxx* functions are reserved for framework-supplied requests.
