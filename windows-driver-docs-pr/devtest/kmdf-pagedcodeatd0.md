# PagedCodeAtD0 rule (kmdf)


The **PagedCodeAtD0** rule specifies that a driver must not mark code as pageable within callback functions that are in the power-up code path.

When a function is marked pageable and the code section is subsequently paged out, the function generates a page fault, which could impact the fast resume behavior of the computer. This happens because the client driver will have to wait until the system drivers can service this page fault.
