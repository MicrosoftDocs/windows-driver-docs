When the driver's [**Cancel**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nc-wdm-driver_cancel) routine exits, the value of the **Irp-&gt;CancelIrql** member is not the current IRQL. Typically, this error occurs when the driver does not call [**IoReleaseCancelSpinLock**](/previous-versions/windows/hardware/drivers/ff549550(v=vs.85)) with the IRQL that was supplied by the most recent call to [**IoAcquireCancelSpinLock**](/previous-versions/windows/hardware/drivers/ff548196(v=vs.85)).

For more information about *Cancel* routines, see [Canceling IRPs](../kernel/canceling-irps.md). For information specific to this warning, see [Points to Consider When Canceling IRPs](../kernel/points-to-consider-when-canceling-irps.md).
