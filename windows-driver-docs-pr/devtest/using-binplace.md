# Using BinPlace


## <span id="ddk_using_binplace_tools"></span><span id="DDK_USING_BINPLACE_TOOLS"></span>


BinPlace is controlled through a combination of the BinPlace command line, various environment variables, and a file known as a *place file*. The *command line* is the actual line that you type in a Command Prompt window or that you include in a batch file. The *environment variables* are constants set globally in Microsoft Windows or locally in your Command Prompt window. The *place file* is a text file that gives BinPlace information about where to place the files it is moving or creating.
