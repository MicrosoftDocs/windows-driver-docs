The Verifier utility has several ways to monitor the actions of Driver Verifier and of the drivers being verified.

The kernel debugger extension **!verifier** can also be used to monitor and report on a number of statistics related to Driver Verifier's activities.  For information about debugger extensions, see [Windows Debugging](../debugger/index.md).
