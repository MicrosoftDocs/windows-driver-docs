# Limitations of TraceView Workspaces


The TraceView workspaces feature has the following limitations.

-   Because the paths and file names that are associated with a trace session are saved in the workspace, the files that are saved in a workspace are reused and overwritten each time you open the workspace. To preserve your files, move or rename them after each trace session.

-   Changes to a workspace are not automatically saved and TraceView does not prompt you to save them.

-   You cannot save a workspace that includes a trace session group. For more information, see [Grouping Trace Sessions](grouping-trace-sessions.md).

-   You can save only one trace session or log display in each workspace. To save more than one trace session or log display, create a trace session group.

-   Workspaces are not saved in files. You cannot move them to a remote computer.

-   Workspaces that are created by one version of TraceView might not be supported in other versions of TraceView.
