# Static Driver Verifier Output Files


SDV generates several different types of output and results files. This section describes the files and how to use them.

This section includes:

[Command-Line Output](command-line-output.md)

[Sdv-map.h](sdv-map-h.md)

When evaluating the results of a SDV verification, you must examine all of the output carefully and investigate any errors.
