# Tools for Device Metadata Packages

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Device metadata is deprecated and will be removed in a future release of Windows. For information about the replacement for this functionality, see **[Driver Package Container Metadata](../install/driver-package-container-metadata.md)**.

The Microsoft Windows Driver Kit (WDK) includes the following tools that you can use to create device metadata packages:

- [Device Metadata Authoring Wizard](device-metadata-authoring-wizard-portal.md)
- [ComputerHardwareIds](computerhardwareids.md)
