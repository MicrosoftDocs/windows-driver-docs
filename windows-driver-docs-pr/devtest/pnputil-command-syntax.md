To run PnPUtil, open a Command Prompt window (**Run as Administrator**) and type a command using the following syntax and parameters.

**Note**Â Â PnPUtil (PnPUtil.exe) is included in every version of Windows, starting with Windows Vista (in the %windir%\\system32 directory).

```

## <span id="Parameters"></span><span id="parameters"></span><span id="PARAMETERS"></span>Parameters


<span id="________a______"></span><span id="________A______"></span> **/a**   
Adds a [driver package](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff544840) to the [driver store](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff544868). The *InfFileName* parameter specifies the path and name of the [INF file](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff547402) in the driver package. For more information about this parameter, see the [Comments](#comments) section later in this topic.

The **/a** switch has the following optional parameters:

<span id="_i"></span><span id="_I"></span>/i  
Installs the [driver package](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff544840) on matching devices that are connected to the system. The driver package is installed after it is added to the [driver store](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff544868).

**Note**Â Â When you add a [driver package](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff544840) to the [driver store](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff544868) by using the **/a** switch, Windows uses a different name (*published name*) for the driver package's [INF file](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff547402). You must use the published name of the INF file for the *PublishedInfFileName* parameter of the **/d** switch.

Â 

<span id="________d______"></span><span id="________D______"></span> **/d**   
Removes a [driver package](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff544840) from the [driver store](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff544868). The *PublishedInfFileName* parameter specifies the published name of the [INF file](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff547402) for the driver package that was added to the driver store. For more information about this parameter, see the [Comments](#comments) section later in this topic.

The **/d** switch has the following optional parameters:

<span id="_f"></span><span id="_F"></span>/f  
Forces the deletion of the specified [driver package](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff544840) from the [driver store](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff544868). You must use this parameter if the specified driver package is installed on a device that is connected to the system. If this parameter is not specified, PnPUtil only removes a driver package if it was not used to install drivers for devices that are connected to the system.

**Note**Â Â Removing the driver package in this manner will not affect the operation of currently connected devices for which drivers were previously installed from the package.

Â 

<span id="________e______"></span><span id="________E______"></span> **/e**   
Enumerates the [driver packages](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff544840) that are currently in the [driver store](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff544868). Only driver packages that are not in-box packages are listed. An *in-box* driver package is one which is included in the default installation of Windows or its service packs.

<span id="_______________"></span> **/?**   
Displays the command-line syntax.

### <span id="comments"></span><span id="COMMENTS"></span> Comments

The *InfFileName* parameter of the **/a** switch is used to specify the name of [driver package's](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff544840)[INF file](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff547402). This parameter has the following syntax:

\[**Drive:\\**\]\[**Path**\]*Filename*

*Filename* can specify one of the following:

-   The name of a single [INF file](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff547402).
-   The names of all INF files or only specific INF files by using the asterisk ('\*') or question mark ('?') wildcard characters.

If you delete a driver package by using the **/d** switch, you must specify the published name of the INF file through the *PublishedInfFileName* parameter. You can obtain this name through one of the following methods:

-   When the driver package is added to the driver store through the **/a** switch, PnPUtil displays the published name of the INF file for the driver package within the [driver store](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff544868).
-   Run PnPUtil and use the **/e** switch to list all the driver packages, together with the published names of their INF files, that are currently within the driver store.
    ```
