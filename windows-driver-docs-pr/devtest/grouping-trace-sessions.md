# Grouping Trace Sessions


You can combine multiple running trace sessions or multiple existing trace log displays into a trace session group. When you do, the trace messages from the grouped sessions or logs appear together in a single [Trace Message List](trace-message-lists.md) pane.

Trace session groups are managed as a single session. For example, if you stop a trace session that is part of a group, TraceView stops all trace sessions in the group. Similarly, if you [filter the trace messages](filtering-trace-messages.md), the filter applies to all trace messages in the group. However, you can still change the properties of a single trace session or its providers while it is part of a group.

The grouping of trace sessions does not affect the [event trace log (.etl) files](trace-log.md), the TraceView listing (.out) files, or the TraceView summary (.sum) files for the trace sessions. Those files record data from each session as though the sessions were not grouped.
