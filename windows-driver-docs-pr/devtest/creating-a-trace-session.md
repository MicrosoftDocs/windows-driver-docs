# Creating a Trace Session


## <span id="ddk_creating_a_real_time_trace_session_tools"></span><span id="DDK_CREATING_A_REAL_TIME_TRACE_SESSION_TOOLS"></span>


This section explains how to use TraceView to create a real-time trace session or a trace log session.

When you *create* a [trace session](trace-session.md), TraceView configures and starts the trace session and enables the [trace providers](trace-provider.md) that you specify, such as the providers in a driver that is instrumented for event tracing.

TraceView uses wizard pages to guide you through the steps of creating the trace session.

TraceView requires that you specify at least one trace provider when creating a trace session. The provider type and the files that are available determine the method that you use to create the trace session.

TraceView requires a [PDB symbol file](pdb-symbol-files.md), a [trace message format (TMF) file](trace-message-format-file.md), or a TMF directory when creating a trace session. TraceView does not use the %TRACE\_FORMAT\_SEARCH\_PATH% environment variable.

When you use the TraceView window to create a trace session, the trace session runs only as long as the window remains open. You cannot close the window and leave the session running. To start a trace session that runs independently of the TraceView window, use the [TraceView command-line interface](traceview-command-line-interface.md).
