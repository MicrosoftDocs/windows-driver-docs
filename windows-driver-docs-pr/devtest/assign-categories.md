# Assign categories in the Device Metadata Authoring Wizard

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Device metadata is deprecated and will be removed in a future release of Windows. For information about the replacement for this functionality, see **[Driver Package Container Metadata](../install/driver-package-container-metadata.md)**.

Categories determine how devices are grouped.

## To assign a device to a category

1. Click the **Categories** tab.
1. Under **Available categories**, select the categories that you want to associate with the device. A device can belong to multiple categories. Select all that apply.

1. Under **Primary category**, select the category that most people use to identify the device.
