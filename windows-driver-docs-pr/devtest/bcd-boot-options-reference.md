# BCDEdit Options Reference

*Boot entry parameters*, or *boot parameters*, are optional, system-specific settings that represent configuration options. You can add boot parameters to a boot entry for an operating system. They are stored in a boot configuration data (BCD) store.

This section describes the boot options for supported versions of WindowsÂ that are related to developing, testing, and debugging drivers on computers with x86-based and x64-based processors. You can add these parameters to the boot entries for Windows operating systems.

> [!CAUTION]
> Administrative privileges are required to use BCDEdit to modify BCD. Changing some boot entry options using the **BCDEdit /set** command could render your computer inoperable. As an alternative, use the System Configuration utility (MSConfig.exe) to change boot settings. For more information, see *[How to open MSConfig in Windows 10](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4026130/windows-how-to-open-msconfig-in-windows-10)*.

> [!NOTE]
> Before setting BCDEdit options you might need to disable or suspend BitLocker and Secure Boot on the computer.
