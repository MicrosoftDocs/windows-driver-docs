# Trace Session List Features


This topic describes the features of the Trace Session List. You can use these features to customize the list.

### <span id="displaying_and_hiding_columns"></span><span id="DISPLAYING_AND_HIDING_COLUMNS"></span>Displaying and Hiding Columns

To display and hide columns of the Trace Session List, right-click any column heading. In the shortcut menu that appears, checked properties are displayed; unchecked properties are hidden. To display or hide a property, select it from the shortcut menu.

You cannot reorder the columns in the Trace Session List.

### <span id="saving_the_column_configuration"></span><span id="SAVING_THE_COLUMN_CONFIGURATION"></span>Saving the Column Configuration

TraceView displays selected columns by default. If you prefer to have different columns displayed and hidden, you can save your column configuration as the new default.

To save a new column configuration, do the following:

1.  In the Trace Session List, right-click any column heading.

2.  Click **Save As Default**.

### <span id="sorting_by_column"></span><span id="SORTING_BY_COLUMN"></span>Sorting by Column

To sort by the values in a column, click the column heading. When you click the column heading repeatedly, the column toggles between the ascending and descending order of the values in that column.

### <span id="other_actions"></span><span id="OTHER_ACTIONS"></span>Other Actions

When a trace session or trace log is displayed in the Trace Session List, you can also perform the following actions:

-   [Stop a trace session](stopping-a-trace-session.md)

-   [Restart a trace session](restarting-a-trace-session.md)

-   [Remove trace sessions](removing-a-trace-session.md)

-   [Manage trace message filters](filtering-trace-messages.md)
