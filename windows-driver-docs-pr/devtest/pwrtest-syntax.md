# PwrTest Syntax


You run PwrTest from a Command Prompt window. You can select and configure [PwrTest Scenarios](pwrtest-scenarios.md) using command options.

The syntax for the PwrTest tool is:

```
pwrtest /scenario [/scenario_options] [/common_options]
```

<span id="_scenario_options"></span><span id="_SCENARIO_OPTIONS"></span>**/**<em>scenario\_options</em>  
To see the options available for each Pwrtest scenario, type: **pwrtest.exe /**<em>scenario</em> **/?**

For example: **pwrtest.exe /sleep /?**

| **/etwmaxbuffers:**<em>n</em> | Specifies the maximum number of buffers allocated for the ETW session if that number is larger than the minimum of 2 per logical processor and larger than the **etwminbuffers** setting. The default is the **etwminbuffers** value + 20. |

### <span id="Remarks"></span><span id="remarks"></span><span id="REMARKS"></span>Remarks

Execution Requirements to support ETW tracing:

-   Pwrtest must run from an administrator or elevated **Command Prompt** window (**Run as administrator**).

-   Pwrtest must run natively (WoW64 not supported).

The group policy settings put in place by your system administrator might interfere with some scenarios that need to temporarily modify power setting values (such as the sleep scenario).

PwrTest automatically generates multiple logs for each execution in .log (plaintext), .xml (format varies per scenario), .wtl (WTTLog), and .etl (ETW trace) log formats.

To be able to use all PwrTest Scenarios, you must first provision a test computer for testing using Visual Studio and the WDK. For more information, see [Provision a computer for driver deployment and testing (WDK 8.1)](../gettingstarted/provision-a-target-computer-wdk-8-1.md), or [Provision a computer for driver deployment and testing (WDK 8)](/previous-versions/hh698272(v=vs.85)). Some scenarios require the power button driver that is part of Windows Driver Testing Framework (WDTF). WDTF (and the included power button driver) is automatically installed when you provision a system for testing using Visual Studio and the WDK. For information about WDTF, see [**Windows Device Testing Framework (WDTF) (Windows Drivers)**](../wdtf/index.md).
