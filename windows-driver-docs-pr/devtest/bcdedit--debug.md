# BCDEdit /debug


The **/debug** boot option enables or disables kernel debugging of the Windows operating system associated with the specified boot entry or the current boot entry.


> [!CAUTION]
> Administrative privileges are required to use BCDEdit to modify BCD. Changing some boot entry options using the BCDEdit command could render your computer inoperable. As an alternative, use the Startup settings in Windows.

> [!NOTE]
> Before setting BCDEdit options you might need to disable or suspend BitLocker and Secure Boot on the computer.


``` syntax
bcdedit /debug [{ID}] { on | off }
```

## Parameters

**{**<em>ID</em>**}**   

The **{**<em>ID</em>**}** is the ID that is associated with the boot entry, such as {DEFAULT} for the default OS boot entry. If you do not specify an **{**<em>ID</em>**}**, the command modifies the operating system that is currently active. For more information about working with boot entry identifiers, see [Boot Options Identifiers](boot-options-identifiers.md).

 **on**   
Enables kernel debugging of the specified boot entry. If a boot entry is not specified, kernel debugging is enabled for the current operating system.

**off**   
Disables kernel debugger of the specified boot entry. If a boot entry is not specified, kernel debugging is disabled for the current operating system.

### Comments

The **/debug** boot option enables kernel debugging for a specific boot entry. Use the **/dbgsettings** option to configure the type of debugging connection to use and the connection parameters. If no **/dbgsettings** are specified for the boot entry, the global debug settings are used. The default values for the global settings are shown in the following table.

|dbgsetting parameter|Default value|
|--- |--- |
|debugtype|Local|
|debugstart|Active|
|noumex|Yes|


The following example enables kernel debugging of the default boot entry.

```console
bcdedit /debug on 
```

To check the current debugging parameter values, use the [BCDEdit /dbgsettings](bcdedit--dbgsettings.md) command as shown here.

```console
bcdedit /dbgsettings
```
