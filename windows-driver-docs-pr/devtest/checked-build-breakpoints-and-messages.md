# Checked Build Breakpoints and Messages

## <span id="ddk_checked_build_breakpoints_and_messages_tools"></span><span id="DDK_CHECKED_BUILD_BREAKPOINTS_AND_MESSAGES_TOOLS"></span>

This topic contains a list and explanation of some of the common breakpoints and [**DbgPrint**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-dbgprint) messages that a driver might encounter in the checked build.

> [!NOTE]
> Checked builds were available on older versions of Windows, before Windows 10 version 1803.
> Use tools such as Driver Verifier and GFlags to check driver code in later versions of Windows.
