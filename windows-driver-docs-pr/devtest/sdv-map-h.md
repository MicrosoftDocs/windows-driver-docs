# Sdv-map.h


Sdv-map.h is a header file that lists the driver entry points that SDV detected in the driver.

SDV creates an Sdv-map.h file in the driver's sources directory when you use a **staticdv /scan** command to scan the driver's source code. SDV uses the function role type declarations to identify the entry points. If you do not use a **staticdv /scan** command, SDV creates an Sdv-map.h file when you use a **staticdv /check** command to run an SDV analysis.

If this file is inaccurate or incomplete, you can correct it, approve it, and then rescan and rerun the verification.
