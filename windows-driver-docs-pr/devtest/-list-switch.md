# /List Switch


The **/List** switch of the Enhanced Storage Certificate Management tool lists all the IEEE 1667-compliant USB storage devices that are connected to the computer. This switch can also be used to list the certificates (together with their properties) within the authentication silo certificate (ASC) store in a specified USB storage device.

```
    EhStorCertMgrCmd /List [-Volume:
    VolumeName
    ]
```

## <span id="Subparameters"></span><span id="subparameters"></span><span id="SUBPARAMETERS"></span>Subparameters


<span id="_______-Volume_______"></span><span id="_______-volume_______"></span><span id="_______-VOLUME_______"></span> **-Volume:**   
The volume name of an IEEE 1667-compliant USB storage. For more information about the format of this parameter, see [Overview of the Enhanced Storage Certificate Management Tool](overview-of-the-enhanced-storage-certificate-management-tool.md).

**Note**  To produce a list of the volume names of the IEEE 1667-compliant USB storage devices that are currently connected to a computer, type **EhStorCertMgrCmd /List** at the command prompt and then press Enter.

If you use the **/List** switch without any parameters, the tool reports on all the IEEE 1667-compliant USB storage devices that are connected to the computer. In this case, only the volume names of the USB storage devices are reported.

For more information about a particular USB storage device, use the **-Volume** parameter to specify the device. In this case, the tool reports on the certificates that are present within the ASC store in the device.

This example shows how to list the IEEE 1667-compliant USB storage devices that are connected to the computer.

```
EhStorCertMgrCmd /List
```

```
Executing list switch...

```

This example shows how to list the details about the certificates within the ASC store of an IEEE 1667-compliant USB storage device.

```
EhStorCertMgrCmd.exe /List -Volume:"\\?\usbstor#ieee1667control&ven_msft&prod_disk_sim_v0.01&rev_0.01#123456789&0&control#{4f40006f-b933-4550-b532-2b58cee614d3}"
