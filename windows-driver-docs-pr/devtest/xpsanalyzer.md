# XpsAnalyzer

XpsAnalyzer (XpsAnalyzer.exe) is a command-line tool that analyzes XML Paper Specification (XPS) files for compatibility with the XPS 1.0 specification.

The tool performs its analysis using a set of XPS rules, which are described in [XpsAnalyzer Rules](xpsanalyzer-rules.md). XpsAnalyzer produces a report that describes the structure and contents of an XPS file based on these rules. The report is generated in XML and HTM format, and can optionally be generated as an SQL file.

For more information about XPS and the structure of an XPS file, download the [XML Paper Specification](https://download.microsoft.com/download/1/6/a/16acc601-1b7a-42ad-8d4e-4f0aa156ec3e/xps_1_0.zip).
