# DevCon Classes

> [!NOTE]
> [PnPUtil](pnputil.md) ships with every release of Windows and makes use of the most reliable and secure APIs available. We recommend using PnPUtil instead of DevCon. See the [Recommended replacement](#recommended-replacement) below and [Replacing DevCon](devcon-migration.md) for more information.

Lists all [device setup classes](../install/overview-of-device-setup-classes.md), including classes that devices on the system do not use.

``` console
devcon classes
```

## Recommended replacement

``` console
pnputil /enum-classes
```

For more recommended replacements, see [Replacing DevCon](devcon-migration.md).

## Comments

In the DevCon display, classes are listed in the order that they appear in the registry (alphanumeric order by GUID).

To find the devices in a setup class, use the **[DevCon ListClass](devcon-listclass.md)** operation. To find the setup class of a particular device, use the **[DevCon Stack](devcon-stack.md)** operation.

## Sample usage

``` console
devcon classes
devcon classes > setupclasses.txt
```
