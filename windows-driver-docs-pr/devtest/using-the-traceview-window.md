# Using the TraceView Window


This section describes the TraceView window and explains how to use it.

The TraceView window can contain one **Trace Session List** and multiple **Trace Message Lists**. The lists appear in independent panes that you can move and arrange by grabbing the double-vertical bar on the left edge of each pane and dragging it to a new location.

This section includes:

[Initial View](initial-view.md)

[Trace Session List](trace-session-list.md)

[Trace Message Lists](trace-message-lists.md)
