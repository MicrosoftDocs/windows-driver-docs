# Opening and Closing the Trace Viewer


You can open the Trace Viewer for any rule in the **Results** tab that reports a defect.

To open the Trace Viewer:

-   In the Results tab, locate the rule you are interested in and click **Defect**.

-   After a brief delay, during which SDV retrieves the information that it needs, the Trace Viewer opens. Then, during a more extended delay, it positions and resizes the windows. A delay of 1 minute or more is considered to be normal.

You can display only one Trace Viewer (for one rule violation) at a time. To open the Trace Viewer for a different rule violation, you must first close the Trace Viewer for the current rule violation.

To close the Defect Viewer, do either of the following:

-   From the **File** menu, select **Exit**.

-   Click the **Close** (**X**) button in the far right corner of the Static Driver Verifier Report.
