# Stopping and Removing a Workspace Session


When you open a workspace, you start a new trace session or a new log display. You use the same procedures for stopping the sessions and removing them from the display as you would for any trace session.

### <span id="to_stop_a_workspace_session"></span><span id="TO_STOP_A_WORKSPACE_SESSION"></span>To stop a workspace session

1.  In the [Trace Session List](trace-session-list.md), right-click any cell of the row that represents a trace session or trace log display.

2.  Click **Stop Trace**.

2.  In the [Trace Session List](trace-session-list.md), right-click any cell of the row that represents a trace session or trace log display that was stopped.
