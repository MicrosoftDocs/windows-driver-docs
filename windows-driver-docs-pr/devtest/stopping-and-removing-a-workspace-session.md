# Stopping and Removing a Workspace Session

When you open a workspace, you start a new trace session or a new log display. You use the same procedures for stopping the sessions and removing them from the display as you would for any trace session.

1.  In the [Trace Session List](trace-session-list.md), right-click any cell of the row that represents a trace session or trace log display.

2.  Click **Stop Trace**.
