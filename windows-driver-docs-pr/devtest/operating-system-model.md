# Operating System Model


An SDV *operating system model* or *harness* consists of partial and abstracted segments of Windows code that act as the operating system during a verification. SDV includes a default operating system model and several specialized models that are used to verify particular [rules](static-driver-verifier-rule.md). SDV assembles the operating system model for a verification during the **Check** step of the [verification process](verification-process.md).

There is also a harness that executes parts of your driver in the same manner as the Windows Operating System by calling into entry points in the driver.
