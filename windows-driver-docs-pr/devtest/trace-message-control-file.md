# Trace Message Control File


**Note**  Before Windows Vista, this type of file was generated by default by [Tracepdb](tracepdb.md). Instead, the Tracepdb tool now generates a MOF (.mof) file that describes the provider information in the binary.
Unless you are using [TraceView](traceview.md), you should ignore references to these TMC files.

 

A *trace message control* (TMC) file is a text file that contains the [control GUID](control-guid.md) for each [trace provider](trace-provider.md) represented in a PDB file. The name of the TMC file is the control GUID of the trace provider, followed by the .tmc file name extension.

[Tracefmt](tracefmt.md) and [TraceView](traceview.md) create a TMC file for each trace provider when they create a [trace message format (.tmf) file](trace-message-format-file.md) from the formatting instructions in a PDB file. [Tracepdb](tracepdb.md) can also generate a TMC file when you use the **-c** option.

The TMC file also contains the following information:

-   The path and file name of the PDB file.

-   The date and time that the PDB file was created.

-   The control GUID for each trace provider.

-   The [trace flags](trace-flags.md) defined by the trace provider.

TraceView uses the TMC file to find the trace flags for each provider. You can use this file as a quick reference to the control GUID of a trace provider.
