# Selecting Flags and Levels


The **Tracing Flags and Level Selection** dialog box allows you to select the [trace flags](trace-flags.md) and [trace level](trace-level.md) for each provider in the trace session. The **Tracing Flags and Level Selection** dialog box conveniently displays all of the flags and levels offered by the provider, so that you do not need to remember them.

Alternately, you can set the **Flags** and **Level** values manually in the **Advanced Log Session Options** dialog box. For information, see [Setting Advanced Trace Session Options](setting-advanced-trace-session-options.md).

This section includes:

The **Tracing Flags and Level Selection** dialog box is enabled only when TraceView can find a [PDB symbol file](pdb-symbol-files.md) for the provider or when it can find a [trace message control (.tmc) file](trace-message-control-file.md) for the provider in the TMF path (which was specified by using the **Set TMF Search Path** option). Otherwise, the **Set Flags and Level** button that opens the **Tracing Flags and Level Selection** dialog box is disabled. The dialog box is always disabled when you use the **Select TMF Files** option.

If the **Tracing Flags and Level Selection** dialog box is disabled, you can set the trace flags and level for the provider manually in the **Advanced Trace Session Options** dialog box. For instructions, see [Setting Advanced Trace Session Options](setting-advanced-trace-session-options.md).

Flags and levels are properties of the trace provider. Typically, the flags represent increasingly detailed reporting levels and levels represent the severity of the event (information, warning, or error).
