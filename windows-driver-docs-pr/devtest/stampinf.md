# Stampinf


Stampinf (Stampinf.exe) is a tool that you can use to update common INF and INX file directives when you build the driver. For information about setting Stampinf options for your project, see [Stampinf Properties for Driver Projects](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/develop/stampinf-properties-for-driver-projects). For information about adding support for Stampinf to a project file, see the [WDK and Visual Studio build environment](wdk-and-visual-studio-build-environment.md) and [Stampinf task](stampinf-task.md).

An INX file is similar to an INF file and is used by KMDF and UMDF drivers to support multiple platforms and KMDF and UMDF versions. For information about INX files, see [Using INX Files to Create INF Files](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff545473).
