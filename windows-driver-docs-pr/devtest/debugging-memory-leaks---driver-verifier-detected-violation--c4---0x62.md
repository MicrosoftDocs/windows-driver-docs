# Debugging memory leaks - DRIVER\_VERIFIER\_DETECTED\_VIOLATION (C4): 0x62


[Driver Verifier](driver-verifier.md) generates [**Bug Check 0xC4: DRIVER\_VERIFIER\_DETECTED\_VIOLATION**](../debugger/bug-check-0xc4--driver-verifier-detected-violation.md) with a parameter 1 value of 0x62 when a driver unloads without first freeing all of its pool allocations. Unfreed memory allocations (also called memory leaks) are a common cause of lowered operating system performance. These can fragment the system pools and eventually cause system crashes.

When you have a kernel debugger connected to a test computer running [Driver Verifier](driver-verifier.md), if Driver Verifier detects a violation, Windows breaks into the debugger and displays a brief description of the error.

## >Debugging memory leaks at driver unload


-   [Use !analyze to display information about the bug check](#use-analyze-to-display-information-about-the-bug-check)
-   [Use the !verifier 3 extension command to find out about the pool allocations](#use-the-verifier-3-extension-command-to-find-out-about-the-pool-allocations)
-   [If you have symbols you can locate where in the source files the memory allocations occurred](#if-you-have-symbols-you-can-locate-where-in-the-source-files-the-memory-allocations-occurred)

-   [Fixing memory leaks](#fixing-memory-leaks)

### Use !analyze to display information about the bug check

As with any bug check that occurs, once you have control of the debugger, the best first step is to run the [**!analyze -v**](../debuggercmds/-analyze.md) command.

```
kd> !analyze -v

DRIVER_VERIFIER_DETECTED_VIOLATION (c4)
A device driver attempting to corrupt the system has been caught.  This is
because the driver was specified in the registry as being suspect (by the
administrator) and the kernel has enabled substantial checking of this driver.
If the driver attempts to corrupt the system, bugchecks 0xC4, 0xC1 and 0xA will
be among the most commonly seen crashes.
Arguments:
Arg1: 00000062, A driver has forgotten to free its pool allocations prior to unloading.
Arg2: 9707712c, name of the driver having the issue.
Arg3: 9c1faf70, verifier internal structure with driver information.
Arg4: 00000003, total # of (paged+nonpaged) allocations that weren't freed.
    Type !verifier 3 drivername.sys for info on the allocations
    that were leaked that caused the bugcheck.
```

A [**Bug Check 0xC4: DRIVER\_VERIFIER\_DETECTED\_VIOLATION**](../debugger/bug-check-0xc4--driver-verifier-detected-violation.md) with a parameter 1 (Arg1) value of 0x62 is described as follows:

DRIVER\_VERIFIER\_DETECTED\_VIOLATION (C4)
Arg1
Arg2
Arg3
Arg4
Cause
Driver Verifier flags
0x62
Name of the driver.
Reserved
Total number of allocations that were not freed, including both paged and non-paged pool.
The driver is unloading without first freeing its pool allocations. In WindowsÂ 8.1, this bug check will also occur if the driver unloaded without first freeing any work items ([**IO\_WORKITEM**](../kernel/eprocess.md)) it had allocated with [**IoAllocateWorkItem**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-ioallocateworkitem). A bug check with this parameter occurs only when the [Pool Tracking](pool-tracking.md) option is active.
Specify [Pool Tracking](pool-tracking.md) (**verifier /flags 0x8**). The Pool Tracking option is enabled with Standard Flags (**verifier /standard** ).
 

### Use the !verifier 3 extension command to find out about the pool allocations

For this particular bug check, the information provided in parameter 4 (Arg4) is the most important. Arg4 shows number of allocations that weren't freed. The output of the [**!analyze**](../debuggercmds/-analyze.md) command also shows the [**!verifier**](../debuggercmds/-verifier.md) debugger extension command that you can use to display what those allocations were. The full output of **!verifier 3 MyDriver.sys** command is shown in the following example:

```
kd> !verifier 3 Mydriver.sys

```

In example, the driver, MyDriver.sys, has two memory allocations and one I/O work item that have not been properly freed. Each listing shows the address of the current allocation, the size, the pool tag used, and the address in the driver code where the request for an allocation was made. If symbols are loaded for the driver in question, it will also show the name of the function next to the caller address.

Of the tags displayed, only one (for the allocation at address 0x8645a000) was supplied by the driver itself (**mdrv**). The tag **VMdl** is used whenever a driver being verified by Driver Verifier makes calls [**IoAllocateMdl**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-ioallocatemdl). Similarly, the tag **Vfwi** is used whenever a driver being verified by Driver Verifier makes a request to allocate a work item using [**IoAllocateWorkItem**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-ioallocateworkitem).

### If you have symbols you can locate where in the source files the memory allocations occurred

When symbols are loaded for the driver, if those symbols contain the line number information, you can use the **ln** *CallerAddress* command to show the line where the call was made. This output will also show the offset in the function that made the allocation.

```
kd> ln 0x9a3bf6ac

```

### Examine the log for memory allocations

Driver Verifier also keeps a circular log of all memory allocations made in kernel space when pool tracking is enabled. By default, the most recent 65,536 (0x10000) allocations are kept. As a new allocation is made, the oldest allocation in the log is overwritten. If the allocations were made recently before the crash, it may be possible to get additional information about the allocation than shown above, specifically the thread address and frames of the kernel stack at the time of the allocation.

This log can be accessed by using the command **!verifier 0x80** *AddressOfPoolAllocation*. Note that this will list all of the allocations and frees in the log for this particular address. To cancel or stop display of the log history, use the keyboard shortcuts: **Ctrl + Break** with WinDbg and **Ctrl + C** with KD.

### Fixing memory leaks

This Driver Verifier bug check is designed to prevent the driver from leaking kernel memory. In each case, the proper fix is to identify any existing code paths where the allocated objects are not freed and ensure they're freed properly.

[Static Driver Verifier](static-driver-verifier.md) is a tool that scans Windows driver source code and reports on possible issues by simulating the exercising of various code paths. Static Driver Verifier is an excellent development-time utility to help identify these kinds of issues.

For other techniques you can use, including scenarios where Driver Verifier is not involved, see [Finding a Kernel-Mode Memory Leak](../debugger/finding-a-kernel-mode-memory-leak.md).
