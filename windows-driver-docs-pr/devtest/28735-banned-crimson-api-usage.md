warning C28735: Banned Crimson API Usage

This warning indicates that a legacy Event Log or other tracing API is being used. These APIs have been replaced by the Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) model, which improves both performance and security. By restricting new uses of these legacy API calls, we ensure that our customers, particularly administrators, have the best possible experience when debugging Windows components using events.
