# Creating a Trace Session with a Control GUID


You can create a trace session by typing or pasting the [Control GUID](control-guid.md) of a trace provider and locating the [trace message format (.tmf) files](trace-message-format-file.md) for its messages.

1.  [Start TraceView](starting-and-exiting-traceview.md).

2.  On the **File** menu, click **Create New Log Session**.

3.  Click **Add Provider**.

4.  Click **Manually Entered Control GUID** and then type or paste the control GUID.

5.  Do one of the following:

6.  -   To specify one or more TMF files , click **Select TMF Files**, click **OK**, click **Add**, and then browse to and select one or more TMF files from the directory. To select TMF files from another directory, click the **Add** button again. Otherwise, click **Done**.
    -   To direct TraceView to search for the TMF files in a specified directory, click **Set TMF Search Path**, click **OK**, browse to the directory, and then click **OK**.

7.  To add additional providers, click **Add Provider**. This step is optional.

8.  Click **Next**.

9.  [Select flags and a level](selecting-flags-and-levels.md), if desired.

10. [Set basic trace session options](setting-basic-trace-session-options.md), if desired.

11. [Set advanced trace session options](setting-advanced-trace-session-options.md), if desired.

If TraceView cannot find a TMF file for the trace provider, it does not add the trace provider to the provider list in the **Create New Log Session** dialog box and it does not display a message that explains why the provider was not added. If the provider does not appear in the provider list, restart the procedure and use the **Select TMF Files** method instead of **Set TMF Search Path**. If you cannot locate a PDB file or a TMF file for the provider, you cannot use TraceView to create a trace session.

When creating a trace session by typing or pasting a control GUID, you can use the **Tracing Flags and Levels Selection** dialog box (which is described in [Selecting Flags and Levels](selecting-flags-and-levels.md)) only when TraceView can find a PDB symbol file for the provider or when it can find a trace message control (.tmc) file for the provider in the TMF path (specified by using the Set TMF Search Path option).

If the TMC file is not available, you can set the trace flags and level for the provider manually in the **Advanced Trace Session Options** dialog box. For instructions, see [Setting Advanced Trace Session Options](setting-advanced-trace-session-options.md).

For information about specifying TMF files, see Set TMF Search Path and Select TMF Files Options.
