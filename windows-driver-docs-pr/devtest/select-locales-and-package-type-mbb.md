# Select locales and package type in the Mobile Broadband Metadata Authoring Wizard

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Device metadata is deprecated and will be removed in a future release of Windows. For information about the replacement for this functionality, see **[Driver Package Container Metadata](../install/driver-package-container-metadata.md)**.

Select the appropriate locale or locales of your metadata package, as well as your package type (Windows 7 or Windows 8).

To do this, follow these steps:

1. Click the **Package Definition** tab.
1. Under **Available locales**, select the ones that you want to associate to the metadata package. This step is required for all metadata packages.
1. Under **Locale Default**, do one of the following:
    - If you want the package to appear in a specific language when a package isn't available for a locale, select the desired language. Only one metadata package can be specified as the Local Default package.
    - If you don't want the package to appear in a specific language when a locale-specific package isn't available, select **No default**.
