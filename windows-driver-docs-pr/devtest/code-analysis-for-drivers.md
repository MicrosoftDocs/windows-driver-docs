# Code Analysis for Drivers


Code Analysis for Drivers is a compile-time static verification tool that detects basic coding errors in C and C++ programs and includes a specialized module that is designed to detect errors in (primarily) kernel-mode driver code.

**Note**  In previous versions of the WDK, the driver-specific module for code analysis was part of a stand-alone tool called PREfast for Drivers (PFD). PREfast for Drivers was also integrated into the WDK Build environment, as part of Microsoft Automated Code Review (OACR). Starting with Windows Driver Kit (WDK) 8, the driver-specific features have been integrated with the [Analyzing Application Quality by Using Code Analysis Tools](/previous-versions/visualstudio/visual-studio-2013/dd264897(v=vs.120)).
