<td align="left"><p>The Device Fundamentals PnP tests force a driver to handle almost all of the PnP IRPs; however, there are three areas that are stressed specifically: removal, rebalance, and surprise removal. The PnP test provides a mechanism to test each of these separately, or to test them all together (that is, as a stress test). This PnP testing is accomplished by using a combination of user-mode API calls (through the test application) and kernel-mode API calls (through an upper-filter driver).</p></td>

<td align="left"><p>The Device Fundamentals Sleep tests run I/O and PnP operations on the specified devices, before and after, or during system sleep state transitions. The Sleep tests ensure that the device under test permits the system to be cycled through all of the supported sleep states. Additionally, it ensures that the device is still functional after these state changes through Simple I/O stress testing.</p></td>
