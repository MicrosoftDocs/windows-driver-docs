# WDK and Visual Studio build environment


The Windows Driver Kit (WDK) 8.1 and WDK 8 introduced a major change to the environment that you use to build a driver. The WDK no longer uses Build.exe. The WDK build environment for drivers uses MSBuild.exe and is fully integrated with the Visual Studio development environment. This means that source files, makefile.inc, makefile.new and other related build files present in the previous version of the WDK are no longer used. The WDK now enables you to create, edit, build, test, and deploy a driver through Visual Studio. The purpose of this document is to provide information to help users familiar with previous WDKs in getting started with the WDK 8.1 and WDK 8.

**Note**  Projects and solutions created with the WDK 8 must be upgraded to work with the WDK 8.1 and Microsoft Visual Studio 2013. Before you open the projects or solutions, run the [ProjectUpgradeTool](projectupgradetool.md). The ProjectUpgradeTool converts the projects and solutions so that they can be built using WDK 8.1.

<td align="left"><p>The Windows Driver Kit (WDK) includes tools that are often used in the build process but are not normally distributed with Visual Studio. These tools are used to sign drivers or driver packages, implement software tracing, or to process and compile resource or message files (stampinf.exe, mc.exe, tracewpp.exe, binplace.exe, etc.). These command-line tools need to be exposed to MSBuild as tasks (contained in targets) so that they can be run during the build process. The WDK provides the necessary components so that you can run these tools as MSBuild tasks when you build your driver.</p></td>
