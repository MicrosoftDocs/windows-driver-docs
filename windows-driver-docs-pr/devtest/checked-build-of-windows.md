This section describes how the Microsoft Windows *checked build* (also known as the *debug build*) of the Windows operating systems differs from the *free build* (also known as the *retail build*) of this operating system. The section describes how the unique features of the checked build can assist in developing and debugging drivers on x86 and x64 platforms. The section also lists several methods for installing and using the checked build in different driver development and debugging environments.
