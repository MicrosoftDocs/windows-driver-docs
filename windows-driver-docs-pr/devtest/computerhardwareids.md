# ComputerHardwareIds


ComputerHardwareIds (ComputerHardwareIds.exe) is a command-line tool that can be used to generate hardware IDs for a specific model of a vendor's computer system. The vendor can use these hardware IDs to match device metadata packages to that specific computer model.

The ComputerHardwareIds tool is supported on systems that run Windows 7 or later versions of the Windows operating system. This tool is included in the Windows Driver Kit (WDK) under the tools\\IOther directory. There are separate versions for 32-bit Windows platforms (tools\\Other\\x86) and 64-bit Windows platforms (tools\\Other\\ia64 and tools\\Other\\amd64).
