# Changing a Rule


To change a rule in a filter:

1.  In the [Trace Session List](trace-session-list.md), right-click any cell in the session, and then click **Manage Filters**.

2.  In the **Manage Filters** dialog box, in the **Current Rules** area, select the rule that you want to change.

3.  To change the order in which the rule is applied, click the **Move Up** or **Move Down** buttons.

4.  To change the elements of the rule, in the **Rule to be Modified or Added** area, change the [elements of the rule](filter-rule-elements.md).

5.  Click **Modify Rule**.

If you have saved the rule in a [workspace](using-traceview-workspaces.md), you must [resave the workspace](saving-or-resaving-a-workspace.md) after changing the rule. Otherwise, the original rule remains in the workspace.
