# Application Verifier


Application Verifier (AppVerif.exe) is a *dynamic verification* tool for user-mode applications. This tool monitors application actions while the application runs, subjects the application to a variety of stresses and tests, and generates a report about potential errors in application execution or design.

Application Verifier can detect errors in any user-mode applications that are not based on managed code, including user-mode drivers. It finds subtle programming errors that might be difficult to detect during standard application testing or driver testing.

You can use Application Verifier alone or in conjunction with a user-mode debugger. The current user must be a member of the Administrators group on the computer.

Application Verifier is included in the [Windows Software Development Kit](https://developer.microsoft.com/windows/downloads/windows-10-sdk/) (SDK). To read the documentation, start Application Verifier and from the **Help** menu, select **Help**, or press F1.
