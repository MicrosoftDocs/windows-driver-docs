# Command-Line Output


When you submit a command to SDV, it displays information about the command as it executes, status messages that indicate the success or failure of the command, and any error messages or warnings that might have been generated. A summary of the results of the verification appears at the bottom of the output.

For example, the following illustration shows the command-line output from a command to verify the SDV-FailDriver-WDM sample driver with the [SpinLock](wdm-spinlock.md) rule. The SDV-FailDriver-WDM sample driver, a driver with intentional coding errors, is located in the \\tools\\sdv\\samples\\Sdv-FailDriver-WDM folder of the Windows Driver Samples.

In this verification, SDV found that the driver violated the rule.

After viewing the results summary to see which rules were violated, you can specify the **/view** option in an MSBuild command to see the Static Driver Verifier Report. For information about the command options, see [Static Driver Verifier commands (MSBuild)](-static-driver-verifier-commands--msbuild-.md). For information about the **Scan**, **Build** and **Check** steps in the output, see [Verification Process](verification-process.md).

The following table describes the results that can appear in the results summary.
