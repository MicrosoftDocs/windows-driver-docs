The current Driver Verifier settings can be displayed by using [Driver Verifier Manager](driver-verifier-manager--windows-xp-and-later-.md). These settings can also be displayed by using the [**Verifier Command Line**](verifier-command-line.md).

The following methods will display the settings that will take effect after the next boot. These will include a list of the Driver Verifier options that have been selected as well as a list of the drivers to be verified.
