# PairTool

PairTool (PairTool.exe) is a command line tool that lets authenticated users and administrators work with devices based on protocols. Some examples include:  

- Enumerate protocol-based devices and their services and device containers.
- Pair and unpair devices.
- Perform a device presence challenge as device lifetime is lossy on many protocols.
