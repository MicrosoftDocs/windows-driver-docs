# Source Code Pane Actions


You can perform the following actions in the **Source Code** pane:

-   **Read a source code file**

    To read a source code file, click the file tab and use the mouse or keyboard to move through the file. As you select lines or move the highlight in the **Source Code** pane, the corresponding code elements in the [Trace Tree pane](trace-tree-pane.md) are highlighted and the values in the [State pane](state-pane.md) change to reflect the values of variables at that point in the rule validation process.

-   **Switch source code files**

    To view a source code file that is not currently displayed, click the tab for that file. The file moves to the top of the file stack. After clicking a tab, you can use the RIGHT ARROW and LEFT ARROW keys to bring a file to the top of the stack.

-   **Copy a source code file**

    You can copy the text from any tab of the **Source Code** pane and paste it into any application that supports rich text format (RTF) files, such as Microsoft Word or WordPad.

    To copy the code that is displayed on any tab in the Source Code pane:

    1.  Click anywhere in the **Source Code** pane tab.
    2.  From the **Edit** menu, select **Select All** (or press CTRL + A).
    3.  From the **Edit** menu, select **Copy** (or press CTRL+C).
