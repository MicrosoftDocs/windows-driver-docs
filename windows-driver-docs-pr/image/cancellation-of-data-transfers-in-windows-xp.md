# Cancellation of data transfers in Windows XP

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This article contains information that applies to obsolete Windows operating systems.

In Microsoft Windows XP and Windows Me, there were two ways for a WIA application to cancel a data transfer:

- Return S_FALSE from the transfer callback routine, **IWiaDataCallback::BandedDataCallback**.

- Call **IWiaItemExtras::CancelPendingIO**. We do not recommend this method and it is not used by any in-box drivers or samples.

There were also two ways for a WIA driver to be notified that the application had canceled a transfer:

- Receive S_FALSE when it called into [**IWiaMiniDrvCallBack::MiniDrvCallback**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wiamindr_lh/nf-wiamindr_lh-iwiaminidrvcallback-minidrvcallback).

- Receive a call to its [**IWiaMiniDrv::drvNotifyPnPEvent**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wiamindr_lh/nf-wiamindr_lh-iwiaminidrv-drvnotifypnpevent) with a WIA_EVENT_CANCEL_IO event.

One problem with the Windows XP implementation is that there is no connection between the two notification methods; that is, if a user calls **IWiaItemExtras::CancelPendingIO** but the driver does not support asynchronous canceling of a data transfer through **IWiaMiniDrv::drvNotifyPnPEvent**, the application will also have to return S_FALSE from **IWiaMiniDrvCallBack::MiniDrvCallback**.

The **IWiaDataCallback** and **IWiaItemExtras** interfaces are described in the Microsoft Windows SDK documentation.
