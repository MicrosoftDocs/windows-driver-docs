# Mass Storage Driver


## <a href="" id="ddk-mass-storage-driver-si"></a>


If your camera is based on the mass storage class specification, it is automatically recognized as a WIA camera device during an AutoPlay action (when a user first plugs in the device, or inserts media into the device). The WIA service, in combination with a Microsoft-supplied WIA minidriver, automatically attaches and supports your device using the Scanner and Camera Wizard. This allows users to immediately transfer pictures from your device to a location they specify.
