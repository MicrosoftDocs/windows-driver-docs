# User Interface Extension Registry Entries





You must provide the COM server class ID for each extension. Note that the class ID of the COM server for each extension is listed as a registry key (not a value) under CLSID\\{WIA\_DIP\_UI\_CLSID}\\shellex, where WIA\_DIP\_UI\_CLSID is the actual GUID returned when the application requests this property. The application uses it as part of the look-up key in the registry. Each extensibility interface can refer to a different class ID. There is no requirement that the same object implement them all. List only those extensions that are implemented. It is not required to list all four.

Because the class ID GUID identifies which driver to use, if all models of your device use the same driver, they can all have the same class ID GUID. If different models use different drivers, then they must have different GUIDs.
