# Achieve Compatibility with IStream Transfers

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This article contains information that applies to obsolete Windows operating systems.

Because the WIA architecture changed to support **IStream**-based data transfers, drivers for Windows Vista and earlier operating systems can be different. You must take several steps to ensure compatibility for the drivers for Windows Vista and older applications.

This section includes:

[Internal Compatibility Layer](internal-compatibility-layer.md)

[Single Driver for Windows Vista and Windows XP](single-driver-for-windows-vista-and-windows-xp.md)

[WIA Driver Versioning](wia-driver-versioning.md)
