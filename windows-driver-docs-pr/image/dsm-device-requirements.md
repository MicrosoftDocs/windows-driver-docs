# DSM Device Requirements


To provide support for Distributed Scan Management, a DSM device (a standalone scanner, or the scanner function in a copier or multifunction printer) must support Web Services, communicate with Active Directory, provide security, and implement user interfaces to enable certain user interactions.

[Web Services](web-services.md)

[Active Directory](active-directory.md)

[Security](security.md)

[User Interfaces](user-interfaces.md)
