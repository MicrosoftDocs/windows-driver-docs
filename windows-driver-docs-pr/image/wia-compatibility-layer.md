# WIA Compatibility Layer


The WIA compatibility layer allows the use of legacy applications and devices with Windows Vista.

There are two functions of the WIA compatibility layer:

1.  Mapping of different item tree architectures and properties between legacy applications and Windows Vista drivers and Windows Vista applications and legacy drivers.

2.  Mapping between the Windows Vista, stream-based data transfer model and the legacy TYMED-based model.
