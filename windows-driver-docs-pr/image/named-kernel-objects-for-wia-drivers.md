# Named Kernel Objects for WIA Drivers





The two most common problems that prevent WIA drivers and external components (such as bundled applications) from sharing named kernel objects are the permissions set for those objects and object namespaces.

[Namespaces for WIA Drivers](namespaces-for-wia-drivers.md)

[Access Permissions for WIA Drivers](access-permissions-for-wia-drivers.md)

There are other serious security-related problems, such as "name squatting," which are not covered here. Driver developers should refer to security-related resources for more complete coverage of those topics.
