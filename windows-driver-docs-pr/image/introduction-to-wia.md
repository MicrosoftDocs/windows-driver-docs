# Introduction to WIA





The Microsoft Windows Image Acquisition (WIA) interface is both an application programming interface (API) and a device driver interface (DDI). The WIA API is designed to allow applications to:

-   Run in a robust and stable environment.

-   Minimize interoperability problems.

-   Enumerate available image acquisition devices.

-   Create connections to multiple devices simultaneously.

-   Query properties of devices in a standard and expandable manner.

-   Acquire device data using standard and high performance transfer mechanisms.

-   Maintain image properties across data transfers.

-   Be notified of a wide variety of device events.

The WIA DDI is designed to minimize the amount of code a hardware vendor must write, while maintaining the flexibility to craft individual solutions. This is accomplished by:

-   Providing a standard device service library that performs most driver operations.

-   Promoting industry device communications standards, such as the Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP), so that one WIA driver supports most WIA devices.

This section presents a brief overview of WIA in the following areas:
