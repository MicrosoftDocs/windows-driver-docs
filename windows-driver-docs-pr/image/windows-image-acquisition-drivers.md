# Windows Image Acquisition Drivers

The Microsoft Windows Image Acquisition (WIA) programming interface is a Still Image (STI) architecture for Windows. This documentation explains how to develop a WIA driver that supports communication to imaging devices such as digital cameras and scanners.

WIA is a full-featured imaging architecture that has evolved from the Windows STI model. WIA provides robustness, reliability, a consistent user experience, and built-in driver support for industry standard protocols such as the Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP) for cameras.

For information about programming imaging applications, see the [WIA Application Programming Interface](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/wia/-wia-wia-application-programming-interface).
