# Creating a User-Mode Still Image Minidriver





All user-mode still image minidrivers must implement the interface methods defined by [IStiUSD COM Interface](istiusd-com-interface.md). This implementation is relatively easy, using the following procedure.

**To implement the methods defined by the IStiUSD COM interface:**

1.  Obtain a GUID for the interface, and include it in a header file and a setup information (INF) file.

2.  Create an implementation file such as ( .cpp).

3.  Create a customized class definition, using **IStiUSD** as an inherited class.

4.  Implement all of the methods that have been defined for the [IStiUSD COM Interface](istiusd-com-interface.md). If a method is not needed, it must return STIERR\_UNSUPPORTED.
