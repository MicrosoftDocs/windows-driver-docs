# Imaging device driver design guide

This section contains information about Windows Image Acquisition (WIA) drivers, Still Image (STI) drivers, and Web Services on Devices (WSD).

> [!NOTE]
> The WIA programming interface is used to develop imaging drivers for modern Windows operating systems.
> The STI programming interface was used to develop imaging drivers in legacy Windows operating systems.
> The STI programming interface documentation will be archived in a future release.

## WIA and STI Driver Reference

The following table contains reference information for Windows Image Acquisition (WIA) drivers and for Still Imaging (STI) drivers. These drivers control devices, including scanners and cameras, that capture still images. For more information about these drivers, see [Windows Image Acquisition Drivers](./windows-image-acquisition-drivers.md) and [Still Image Drivers](./still-image-drivers.md).

The following sections describe the interfaces, functions, structures, and properties used by WIA and STI drivers.
