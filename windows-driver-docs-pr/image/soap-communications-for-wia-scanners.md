# SOAP Communications for WIA Scanners


A WIA driver that uses WSD communicates with the scanner device by using Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP), which is a protocol that forms the foundation layer of the web services stack.

The driver must use the Function Discovery service to initialize SOAP communications with the device.
