# WIA Scanner Storage


This section explains the WIA item tree structure that is introduced in Windows Vista for scanners that are equipped with digital storage that is capable of holding still images and other types of acquired data.

Such storage could be either fixed (for example, a hard disk drive) or removable (for example, a Compact Flash memory card). This storage can be added internally or attached externally to the scanner; it may contain other types of data along with scanned images.

This section includes:
