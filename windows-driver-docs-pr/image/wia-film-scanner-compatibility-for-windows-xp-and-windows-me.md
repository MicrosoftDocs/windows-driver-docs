# WIA Film Scanner Compatibility for Windows XP and Windows Me





Film scanning items do *not* exist for Microsoft Windows XP or Windows Me. A film scanner (either a dedicated film scanner or a film scanner attachment on a flatbed scanner) will not be available to a Windows XP WIA application that runs on Windows Vista. The [WIA Compatibility Layer](wia-compatibility-layer.md) that is found in the Windows Vista WIA service handles only flatbed and basic feeder items (WIA\_CATEGORY\_FLATBED and WIA\_CATEGORY\_FEEDER) for Windows Vista devices when they are used with Windows XP applications; film and storage items (WIA\_CATEGORY\_FILM and WIA\_CATEGORY\_FINISHED\_FILE) are not translated.

You can provide rudimentary support for Windows XP WIA applications that run Windows Vista if you implement a flatbed item to mimic the basic functionality of the film item. The default user interface that is presented to the user would be the same as a flatbed scanner, so the application would only receive a single frame. And, even with such a flatbed item, the Windows Vista driver would not work on Windows XP because it provides only limited support for Windows XP applications on Windows Vista.

**Note**   If your scanner also supports flatbed scanning, the WIA flatbed scanner item must be the first WIA child item in the scanner item tree.
