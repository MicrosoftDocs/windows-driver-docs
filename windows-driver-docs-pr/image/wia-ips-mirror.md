# WIA_IPS_MIRROR

## Remarks

The WIA_IPS_MIRROR property is not related to the [**WIA_IPS_ORIENTATION**](wia-ips-orientation.md) property. WIA_IPS_ORIENTATION specifies the orientation of the document to be scanned in relationship to the direction of the scan; in contrast, WIA_IPS_MIRROR specifies an operation that is to be applied to an image after it is scanned.
