## Remarks

An application reads the WIA_DPS_DOCUMENT_HANDLING_STATUS property to determine whether a scanner device is ready to use. Reading this property is an ideal way to check whether paper is in the feeder before a user acquires an image. The WIA minidriver creates and maintains this property.
