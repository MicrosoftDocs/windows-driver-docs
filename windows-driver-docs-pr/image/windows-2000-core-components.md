# Windows 2000 Core Components


## <a href="" id="ddk-windows-2000-core-components-si"></a>


The still image core components on Windows 2000 are shown in the following figure.

The still image core components on Windows 2000 are almost identical to the [Windows 98 Core Components](windows-98-core-components.md). The three differences between these operating systems are the following:

1.  *Stisvc.exe* replaces the Windows 98 *stimon.exe* component.

2.  The system provides a serial port kernel-mode driver, *serscan.sys*.

3.  *Scsimap.dll* does not exist for Windows 2000 and later.
