| Element |
|--|
| [**JobEndState**](jobendstate.md) |

## Remarks

A scan job is *complete* when all processing has completed, either because scanning and document transfer completed successfully or because a fatal error was encountered.

The specified time refers to the internal clock of the scan device and does not need to be a real time clock.
