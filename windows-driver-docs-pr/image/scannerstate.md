## Remarks

[**GetScannerElementsRequest**](getscannerelementsrequest.md)

The WSD Scan Service informs a client about changes to the scanner's status by sending a [**ScannerStatusSummaryEvent**](scannerstatussummaryevent.md) event. A client can directly query the scanner's state by calling the [**GetScannerElementsRequest**](getscannerelementsrequest.md) operation.

You can both extend and subset the allowed values for this element.
