# ScansCompleted element

The required **ScansCompleted** element specifies the number of images that are scanned.

## Usage

<wscn:ScansCompleted>
  text
</wscn:ScansCompleted>
```

## Attributes

There are no attributes.

## Text value

Required. An integer value from 1 through 2147483648.

## Parent elements

| Element |
|--|
| [**JobEndState**](jobendstate.md) |
| [**JobStatus**](jobstatus.md) |
| [**JobSummary**](jobsummary.md) |

## Remarks

If a sheet of media is scanned multiple times, the WSD Scan Service must increment the **ScansCompleted** count every time. Each side of a media sheet is scanned in duplex mode, generating two scans in the **ScansCompleted** count.

The **ScansCompleted** count might not be known until the scanner has completed processing the job. The WSD Scan Service must update the **ScansCompleted** element when more exact information is available.
