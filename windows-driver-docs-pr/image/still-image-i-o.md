# Still Image I/O





Still image devices can use the Microsoft-provided WDM-based kernel-mode drivers on SCSI and USB buses. You need to provide bus drivers for buses that are not supported by Microsoft drivers.

For more information about using SCSI and USB bus drivers with still image devices see: [Accessing Kernel-Mode Drivers for Still Image Devices](accessing-kernel-mode-drivers-for-still-image-devices.md).

This section contains additional information about SCSI and USB I/O control codes and the structures associated with these control codes.
