# WIA_DPC_PICT_WIDTH

The WIA_DPC_PICT_WIDTH property describes the width, in pixels, to use for newly captured images.

Property Type: VT_I4

Valid Values: WIA_PROP_LIST or WIA_PROP_RANGE

Access Rights: Read/write

## Remarks

The list of valid values for the WIA_DPC_PICT_WIDTH property has a one-to-one correspondence to the list of valid values for the [**WIA_DPC_PICT_HEIGHT**](wia-dpc-pict-height.md) property. If the individual width and height are linearly settable and orthogonal to each other, you can express them as a range.

## Requirements

**Version:** Obsolete in Windows Vista and later operating systems and should not be used.

**Header:** wiadef.h (include Wiadef.h)
