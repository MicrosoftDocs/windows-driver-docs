# WIA Scanner Storage Compatibility for Windows XP and Windows Me


The WIA service in Windows Vista contains an internal compatibility layer so that you can use legacy Windows XP drivers and applications with new Windows Vista applications and drivers. The compatibility layer provides translation only for the flatbed and feeder items. Because storage items do *not* exist for Windows XP or Windows Me and are not translated by the compatibility layer, storage items will not be available for a legacy WIA application.

For additional notes on Windows XP and Windows Me compatibility, see [WIA Flatbed Scanner Compatibility for Windows Me and Windows XP](wia-flatbed-scanner-compatibility-for-windows-xp-and-windows-me.md).
