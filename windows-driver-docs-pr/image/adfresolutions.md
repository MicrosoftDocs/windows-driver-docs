# ADFResolutions element

The required **ADFResolutions** element contains a list of resolutions at which the front or back side of the scanner's automatic document feeder (ADF) can scan.

## Usage

```xml
<wscn:ADFResolutions>
  child elements
</wscn:ADFResolutions>
```

## Attributes

There are no attributes.

## Child elements

| Element |
|--|
| [**Height**](height.md) |
| [**Width**](width.md) |

## Parent elements

| Element |
|--|
| [**ADFBack**](adfback.md) |
| [**ADFFront**](adffront.md) |

## Remarks

The resolution is specified as a [**Width**](width.md) x [**Height**](height.md) pair, where both **Width** and **Height** are specified in pixels per inch.

If the parent element of the **ADFResolutions** element is [**ADFFront**](adffront.md), the specified resolution applies to the front side of the ADF; otherwise, the parent element is [**ADFBack**](adfback.md) and the resolution applies to the back side of the ADF.

The WSD Scan Service should list all possible widths that the scan device supports within the **Widths** child element and all possible heights that the scan device supports within the **Heights** child element. All **Width** and **Height** values are independent of each other, and most devices will support them being paired in any combination within a [**ScanTicket**](scanticket.md) element.
