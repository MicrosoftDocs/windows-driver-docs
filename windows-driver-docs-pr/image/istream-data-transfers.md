# IStream Data Transfers


In operating systems before Windows Vista, WIA supported two transfer methods: [in-memory](in-memory-transfers.md) and [file](file-transfers.md) transfers. Beginning with Windows Vista, WIA also supports stream-based data transfers.

This section includes:

[WIA Transfer Architecture](wia-transfer-architecture.md)

[Multipage IStream Transfers](multipage-istream-transfers.md)

[Cancellation of IStream Data Transfers](cancellation-of-istream-data-transfers.md)
