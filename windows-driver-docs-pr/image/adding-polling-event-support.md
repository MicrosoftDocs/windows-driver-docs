# Add Polling Event Support

To properly set up your WIA driver to report polling events, do the following:

1. Set **Capabilities=0x33** in your device's INF file. (See [INF Files for WIA Devices](inf-files-for-wia-devices.md) for details.)

2. Report STI\_GENCAP\_NOTIFICATIONS and STI\_USD\_GENCAP\_NATIVE\_PUSHSUPPORT in the [**IStiUSD::GetCapabilities**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/stiusd/nf-stiusd-istiusd-getcapabilities) method.

3. Report all supported events in the [**IWiaMiniDrv::drvGetCapabilities**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wiamindr_lh/nf-wiamindr_lh-iwiaminidrv-drvgetcapabilities) method.

4. Respond to calls to the [**IStiUSD::GetStatus**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/stiusd/nf-stiusd-istiusd-getstatus) method. The WIA service calls this method at a preset interval that is configurable in the INF file. The default setting is a 1-second interval.

5. Report the proper event information response in the [**IStiUSD::GetNotificationData**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/stiusd/nf-stiusd-istiusd-getnotificationdata) method.

The WIA service calls the **IStiUSD::GetStatus** method for two major operations:

1. Checking the device's online status.

2. Polling for device events, such as a push button event.

Determining the operation request can be done by checking the **StatusMask** member of the [**STI\_DEVICE\_STATUS**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/sti/ns-sti-_sti_device_status) structure. The **StatusMask** member can be either of the following requests:

STI\_DEVSTATUS\_ONLINE\_STATE  
This operation request checks whether the device is online and should be filled by setting the **dwOnlinesState** member of the STI\_DEVICE\_STATUS structure.

STI\_DEVSTATUS\_EVENTS\_STATE  
This operation request checks for device events. It should be filled by setting the **dwEventHandlingState** member of the STI\_DEVICE\_STATUS structure. The value that should be used is STI\_EVENTHANDLING\_PENDING. (The device has an event pending and is waiting to report it to the WIA service.)

When STI\_EVENTHANDLING\_PENDING is set, the WIA service is signaled that an event has occurred in the WIA driver. The WIA service calls the **IStiUSD::GetNotificationData** method to get more information about the event.

The **IStiUSD::GetNotificationData** method is called for polled events and interrupt events. It is in this method that you should fill out the proper event information to return to the WIA service.

**Note**  Always clear the STI\_EVENTHANDLING\_PENDING flag in the **dwEventHandlingState** member to ensure that it is properly set when a device event occurs.
This WIA driver should set the *m\_guidLastEvent* class member variable to the proper event GUID when an event is detected. The *m\_guidLastEvent* is checked at a later time when the WIA service calls the **IStiUSD::GetNotificationData** method. The *m\_guidLastEvent* member variable is defined in the **CWIADevice** class (in the following code snippet), used to cache the last event signaled. After this member variable has been requested by the WIA service, it is always set to GUID\_NULL.

The following example shows an implementation of the [**IStiUSD::GetStatus**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/stiusd/nf-stiusd-istiusd-getstatus) method.

```cpp
STDMETHODIMP CWIADevice::GetStatus(PSTI_DEVICE_STATUS pDevStatus)
{
  //
  // If the caller did not pass in the correct parameters,
  // then fail the call with E_INVALIDARG.
  //

  if(!pDevStatus)
  {
      return E_INVALIDARG;
  }

  HRESULT hr = S_OK;

  //
  // If we are asked, verify state of an event handler 
  //(front panel buttons, user controlled attachments, etc.).
  //
  // If your device requires polling, then this is where you would
  // specify the event result.
  // However, It is not recommended to have polled events.
  // Interrupt events are better for performance, and reliability.
  // See the SetNotificationsHandle method for how to
  // implement interrupt events.
  //

  //
  // clear the dwEventHandlingState field first to make sure we are really setting
  // a pending event.
  //

  pDevStatus->dwEventHandlingState &= ~STI_EVENTHANDLING_PENDING;
  if (pDevStatus->StatusMask & STI_DEVSTATUS_EVENTS_STATE) {

    //
    // set the polled event result here, for the GetNotificationData()
    // method to read and report.
    // (m_guidLastEvent will be read in GetNotificationData)
    //

    LONG lEventResult = 0;
    PollMyDeviceForEvents(&lEventResult)

    if(lEventResult == DEVICE_SCAN_BUTTON_PRESSED) {

        //
        // polled event result was one we know about
        //

        m_guidLastEvent = WIA_EVENT_SCAN_IMAGE;
    } else {

        //
        // nothing happened, so continue
        //

        m_guidLastEvent = GUID_NULL;
    }

    if (m_guidLastEvent != GUID_NULL) {

        //
        // if the event GUID is NOT GUID_NULL, set the
        // STI_EVENTHANDLING_PENDING flag letting the WIA service
        // know that we have an event ready. This will tell the WIA
        // service to call GetNotificationData() for the event
        // specific information.
        //

        pDevStatus->dwEventHandlingState |= STI_EVENTHANDLING_PENDING;
    }
  }
  return S_OK;
}
```
