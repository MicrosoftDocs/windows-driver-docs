# Overview of Driver Technologies

For general information about developing drivers see [Getting started with Windows drivers](gettingstarted/index.md) and [Write your first driver](gettingstarted/writing-your-first-driver.md).

The majority of the driver technology information is the same for all editions of Windows 10. When you must make special considerations for a particular edition of Windows, such as for Windows 10 Mobile, we explicitly called these out in each technology area.

## Windows drivers

You can create a Windows Driver—a driver that uses a subset of the available interfaces—to run on all editions of Windows 10. Where possible, use a Windows Driver to enable deployment of your drivers on multiple devices. For more information about how to build, install, deploy, and debug a Windows Driver for Windows 10, see [Getting Started with Windows Drivers](develop/getting-started-with-windows-drivers.md) and [Deploying a Driver to a Test Computer](develop/deploying-a-driver-to-a-test-computer.md).

## Device drivers and Windows 10 for desktop computers

For information about the tools used to develop desktop drivers, see [Driver Development Tools](devtest/index.md) and [Tools for Verifying Drivers](devtest/tools-for-verifying-drivers.md). For information about deploying drivers to Windows 10 on a desktop, see [Device and Driver Installation](install/index.md). For information about troubleshooting driver installation, see [Troubleshooting Configuration of Driver Deployment, Testing and Debugging](develop/troubleshooting-configuration-of-driver-deployment--testing-and-debugging.md).
