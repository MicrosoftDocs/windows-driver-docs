      - question: |
          How are custom capabilities different from other capabilities?
        answer: |
          1. Microsoft partners can define custom capabilities.
          2. Custom capabilities do not have to be built in to Windows at compile time.
          3. Windows verifies that an app is authorized to use a custom capability when the app installs.  For other capabilities, this verification happens when the Windows Store receives the app submission.
