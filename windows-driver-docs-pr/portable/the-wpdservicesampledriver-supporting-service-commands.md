# Supporting the Service Commands


WPD issues service commands when an application calls several methods that are found in the service interfaces that are supported by the WPD API.

In the sample driver, these service commands are first processed by the **WpdService::DispatchMessage** method. This method examines the given command and forwards it to the appropriate handler. The sample driver forwards any of the capability commands to a handler in the *WpdServiceCapabilities.cpp* module. The sample driver forwards any of the method commands to a handler in the *WpdServiceMethods.cpp* module.

The following table describes the commands that are supported by the service module, together with their descriptions and handlers.

WPD applications use the methods that are found in the **IPortableDeviceServiceCapabilities** interface to discover the functionality that is offered by a service. By using the methods in this interface, an application can retrieve descriptions of supported methods, events, and formats. And, an application can retrieve even more specific data such as the attributes of a particular parameter for a given method.

In the sample driver, the **WpdService::DispatchMessage** method examines the **fmtid** field of all incoming commands. If this field is set to WPD\_CATEGORY\_SERVICE\_CAPABILITIES, it forwards the command to the **WpdServiceCapabilities::DispatchWpdMessage** method which, in turn, processes the command. (The **WpdServiceCapabilities::DispatchWpdMessage** method is found in the *WpdServiceCapabilities.cpp* file.)

The following table describes the 14 capability commands that are supported by the **WpdServiceCapabilities::DispatchWpdMessage** method, together with their descriptions and handlers.

A WPD application invokes the methods that are supported by a given service by calling one of two methods that are found in the **IPortableDeviceServiceMethods** interface. The **IPortableDeviceServiceMethods::Invoke** method invokes a method synchronously while the **IPortableDeviceServiceMethods::InvokeAsync** method invokes a given method asynchronously.

When an application calls either of these two methods, the WPD API, in turn, issues the WPD\_COMMAND\_SERVICE\_METHODS\_START\_INVOKE command to the driver.

In the sample driver, the WPD\_COMMAND\_SERVICE\_METHODS\_START\_INVOKE command results in calls to the methods in the following table, which are found in the *WpdServiceMethods.cpp* module.

| Method name                          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **WpdServiceMethods::OnStartInvoke** | Calls the **StartMethod** helper function and upon completion, returns the invoked method's context in an **IPortableDeviceValues** object.                                                                           |
| **WpdServiceMethods::StartMethod**   | Verifies that the given service supports the requested method, and if it does, creates a new **ServiceMethodContext** object. After the context is created, the **ServiceMethodContext::Initalize** method is called. |
| **ServiceMethodContext::Initialize** | Creates a **CMethodTask** object and invokes the **CMethodTask::Run** method.                                                                                                                                         |
| **CMethodTask::Run**                 | Creates a separate thread in which the invoked method can run.                                                                                                                                                        |

 

When the **WpdServiceMethods::OnStartInvoke** method is called, WPD passes a GUID identifier for the method being invoked. This GUID is passed in the data to which the *pParams* argument points.

The GUIDs for supported methods are found in the *ContactDeviceService.h* and *FullEnumSyncDeviceService.h* header files.

The method context is a string that the driver and WPD use to identify and target a given method's invocation. For example, WPD uses this string when it issues the command to cancel a specific invocation of a given method or to signal the completion of that method.

When a method completes, the driver sends a WPD\_EVENT\_SERVICE\_COMPLETE event to the WPD API. The event data includes the method context that the driver created when it invoked that method. Upon receiving this event notification, the WPD API issues the WPD\_COMMAND\_SERVICE\_METHODS\_END\_INVOKE command and includes the method context with this command. When the sample driver receives this command, it results in calls to the following methods that are found in *WpdServiceMethods.cpp*.

| Method name                        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **WpdServiceMethods::OnEndInvoke** | Calls the **EndMethod** helper function and upon completion, returns the invoked method's results and status code. This method also performs any necessary clean up of resources that are associated with the method context. |
| **WpdServiceMethods::EndMethod**   | Retrieves the invoked method's results and status code..                                                                                                                                                                      |
