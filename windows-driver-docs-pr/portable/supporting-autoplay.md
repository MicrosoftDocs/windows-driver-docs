# Supporting AutoPlay


AutoPlay is a feature of the Shell that detects content on portable devices. Depending on the current AutoPlay settings, this feature will perform one of several actions, such as presenting a list of available handler applications, displaying a standard folder view of files, and so on.

In Windows Vista, the AutoPlay feature was extended so that a WPD device can provide a list of content types that it supports. Similarly, WPD applications can register content types that they support. (For more information about registering an application, see the WPD SDK.)

The WPD AutoPlay scheme integrates with the Windows Vista AutoPlay feature. It does so by supporting three AutoPlay categories, which are described in the following table.

| Category | Description                                                                                                         |
|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Source   | A WPD device can be treated as a source of content, that is, the content can be transferred from the device.        |
| Sink     | A WPD device can be treated as a destination for content, that is, the content can be transferred to the device.    |
| Function | A WPD device supports a programmable or controllable capability, for example, it can send and receive SMS messages. |

 

Devices that support these categories should set the appropriate entries in the Device\_AddReg section of the setup information (.inf) file. The following table lists the two AutoPlay directives that are supported by the WPD Class Installer.

<td align="left">This directive is required.
<ul>
<li>The reg root must be "HKR".</li>
<li>The type must be 0x10001.</li>
<li>A valid value (0 or 1) must be set.</li>
</ul>
<p>Example:</p>
<p><code>[Device_AddReg]</code></p>
<p><code>HKR,,"EnableDefaultAutoPlaySupport",0x10001,1</code></p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

 

Most devices will specify the EnableDefaultAutoPlaySupport directive in their setup information files. The AutoPlaySourceOnly directive is provided only for legacy devices that do not support bi-directional transfers.

If you do not want your device to participate in AutoPlay, either set the EnableAutoPlaySupport directive to 0 or omit this directive from your driver's setup information (.inf) file. If you explicitly need to disable any AutoPlay functionality for a given WPD device, you can do so by creating a false DeviceHandlers value in the Device\_Parameters section of the .inf file.

If you need to create a custom AutoPlay scheme, you can do so by creating a private DeviceHandlers value in the Device\_Parameters section of the setup information (.inf) file.
