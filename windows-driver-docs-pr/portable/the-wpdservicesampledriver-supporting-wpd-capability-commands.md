# Support for capability commands (WpdServiceSampleDriver sample)


The sample driver supports ten capability commands for a device and 14 capability commands for a service. The code that supports the device-capability commands is found in *WpdCapabilities.cpp*. The code that supports the service-capability commands is found in *WpdServiceCapabilities.cpp*. WPD invokes these commands when an application retrieves device-capability or service-capability data. For example, when an application calls **IPortableDeviceServiceCapabilities::GetSupportedFormats**, WPD issues a corresponding WPD\_COMMAND\_SERVICE\_CAPABILITIES\_GET\_SUPPORTED\_FORMATS command to the driver to retrieve the supported formats for a given service.

The device-capability commands are issued when an application calls one of several methods in the **IPortableDeviceCapabilities** interface. These commands are processed initially by the **WpdCapabilities::DispatchMessage** method that in turn, invokes a corresponding command handler. The **DispatchMessage** method and the individual handlers are found in the *WpdCapabilities.cpp* file.The following table describes each of the device-capability commands together with the names of the handlers that **DispatchMessage** calls when it processes a given command.
