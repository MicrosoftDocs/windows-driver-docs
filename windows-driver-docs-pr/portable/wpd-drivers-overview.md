# WPD Drivers Overview


Windows Portable Devices (WPD) provides an infrastructure to enable multifunction devices that store various media and non-media content. An example of a multi-function device is a cellular phone that contains a built-in zoom camera (a digital camera function) and supports music synchronization and playback (a portable media player function). Additionally, WPD makes these devices accessible from a Windows-based computer.

The object-based Device-Driver Interface (DDI) enables convergent devices, initially focused on smart storage devices such as portable media players, digital still cameras, and mobile phones. Along with a DDI, WPD implements a class driver solution for the following standard protocols and transports:

-   Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP) over USB, IP, and Bluetooth
-   Media Transfer Protocol (MTP) over USB, IP, and Bluetooth
-   Mass Storage Class (MSC) over USB
