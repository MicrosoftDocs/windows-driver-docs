# Buy hardware for using MITT

The Multiple Interface Test Tool (MITT) is a test tool for validating hardware and software for simple peripheral buses, such as UART, I2C, SPI, and GPIO. MITT uses the FPGA development board and includes a software package with firmware, test binaries, and drivers that provide an inexpensive test solution.

To use the Multiple Interface Test Tool (MITT), you need a MITT board and bus-specific adapter boards that plug into ports on the MITT board. The type of adapter board depends on the bus you want to test.

- **MITT board**

    For example, FPGA development board (Nexys2). See [FPGA board from Digilent](https://store.digilentinc.com/nexys-2-spartan-3e-fpga-trainer-board-retired-see-nexys-4-ddr/).

- **UART/SPI adapter board**

    See [UART/SPI adapter board from JJG Technologies.](http://www.jjgtechnologies.com/UART-SPI.htm)

- **GPIO adapter board**

    See [GPIO adapter board from JJG Technologies.](http://www.jjgtechnologies.com/GPIO.htm)

- **MCATT expansion board**

    See [MCATT expansion board from JJG Technologies.](http://www.jjgtechnologies.com/mcatt.htm)

- **Touch simulator pad**

    Touch simulator pad and a band cable to connect to the adapter. MCATT tool is able to stimulate a capacitive touch device by stimulating the precise points that come in contact with the board. The boards can be customized to have various sized and contact point resolutions.

    These pad is customized for the device to test.

  - Specific size
  - Number of touch points
  - Distance between the touch points
