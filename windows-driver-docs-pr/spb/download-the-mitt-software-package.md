# Download the MITT software package

The MITT software package contains several tools to be used to test simple peripheral buses such as I2C, SPI, and GPIO with the MITT board. The suite of tools include utilities to update firmware, send requests to simulate test cases, and test driver packages, test the functionality of the bus, its controller and devices connected to the bus.

**[Download the MITT software package](https://download.microsoft.com/download/7/7/0/7703F03C-9D1F-45FC-A625-9647DC495EE2/MITT.msi)**
