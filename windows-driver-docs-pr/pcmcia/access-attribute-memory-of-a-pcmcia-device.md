# Access Attribute Memory of a PCMCIA Device





This section describes how drivers for PCMCIA devices in Microsoft Windows 2000 and later operating systems can access the attribute memory of a PCMCIA device:

-   [Requirements for Accessing Attribute Memory of a PCMCIA Device](./requirements-for-accessing-attribute-memory-of-a-pcmcia-device.md)

-   [Access PCMCIA Attribute Memory by Using a Plug and Play I/O Request](./access-pcmcia-attribute-memory-by-using-a-plug-and-play-i-o-request.md)

    This is a simple method that is sufficient for most purposes, but can only run at IRQL &lt; DISPATCH\_LEVEL.

-   [Access PCMCIA Attribute Memory by Using a BUS\_INTERFACE\_STANDARD Interface](./access-pcmcia-attribute-memory-by-using-a-bus-interface-standard-inter.md)

    This method eliminates the overhead of an I/O request and can run at IRQL &lt;= DISPATCH\_LEVEL

-   [Access PCMCIA Attribute Memory Through a Permanent Memory Window](./access-pcmcia-attribute-memory-through-a-permanent-memory-window.md)

    A driver's ISR can use this method to directly access memory while running at IRQL DIRQL.

-   [Access PCMCIA Attribute Memory by Using a PCMCIA\_INTERFACE\_STANDARD Interface](./access-pcmcia-attribute-memory-by-using-a-pcmcia-interface-standard-in.md)

    Memory card drivers can use this method at IRQL &lt;= DISPATCH\_LEVEL.

These methods are supported by *pcmcia.sys*, the system driver for a PCMCIA bus in Windows 2000 and later operating systems.
