# Functionality of the PCMCIA\_INTERFACE\_STANDARD Interface





This section describes the functionality of the PCMCIA\_INTERFACE\_STANDARD interface that PCMCIA bus driver supports in Windows 2000 and later operating systems. The PCMCIA\_INTERFACE\_STANDARD interface provides a set of routines that can be called directly by a PCMCIA driver. These interface routines support the following operations:

-   Modify the attributes of the memory window that is mapped by the PCMCIA bus driver

-   Set the *Vpp* (secondary power source) level for the device

-   Determine if the card memory is write-protected

For more information about the routines provided by the PCMCIA\_INTERFACE\_STANDARD interface, see [PCMCIA\_INTERFACE\_STANDARD Interface Memory Card Routines](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff537607).
