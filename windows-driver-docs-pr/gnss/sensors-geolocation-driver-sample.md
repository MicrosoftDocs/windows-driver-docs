# Geolocation driver sample for Windows 8.1

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This documentation and the geolocation driver sample for Windows 8.1 has been deprecated.

The geolocation sample driver for Windows 8.1 demonstrates a sensor driver for a Global Positioning System (GPS) device. This driver does not connect to hardware; otherwise, it is fully compliant with best practices for building a UMDF sensor driver. Instead of sending real coordinates, this sample simulates a sensor that issues altitude, latitude, longitude, and other simulated GPS data. In addition, this sample issues a timestamp that is useful when testing and debugging.

This sample serves three purposes: First, it demonstrates the minimal functionality required by a UMDF sensor driver. Second, it provides a skeleton on which you can build a working driver. Third, it includes support for the Radio Management API that provides notifications of radio-state changes for devices like a GPS.
