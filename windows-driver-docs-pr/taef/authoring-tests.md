# Authoring Tests


TAEF supports running tests that have been written in a variety of development languages. Currently, it supports tests written in native C++, managed code, and scripting languages. In each scenario, the tests are marked-up using language-specific constructs. Code within TAEF interprets the final test files and describes them to the TAEF engine in an intermediate representation. TAEF then manipulates this intermediate representation without having concrete details of how the tests were written.
