# Standard Test Metadata


The following Test 'mark-up' metadata is standard metadata that can be applied to TAEF tests.

## <span id="Implicit_Metadata"></span><span id="implicit_metadata"></span><span id="IMPLICIT_METADATA"></span>Implicit Metadata


Certain pieces of metadata are automatically inferred from the markup of the tests:

-   "Name" - the fully qualified name of the test.
-   "Architecture" - the processor architecture of the DLL. This value will be one of 'x86', 'x64' or 'arm'.
-   "TestFile" - The DLL file that the test was described in.

## <span id="Selection_Metadata"></span><span id="selection_metadata"></span><span id="SELECTION_METADATA"></span>Selection Metadata


The selection metadata are simply 'preferred' pieces of metadata to allow teams to have a standard to allow them to better consume one another's tests. There is no required metadata - mandating metadata increases the cost of adding automation, and all metadata should be optional, or should enable 'opt-in' behavior.

There are cases when multiple values can be specified for a metadata value, in which case you should use a semicolon-separated list, and use a 'contains' style selection query, to test for it. For example, if the "Owner" metadata needs two values, then it should be set to "Someone;SomeoneElse". The query to select tests that are owned only by Someone would be:

``` syntax
te Wex.Common.Tests.dll /select:@Owner='Someone'
```

Whereas, the following query would select tests that are owned or co-owned by Someone:

``` syntax
te Wex.Common.Tests.dll /select:@Owner='*Someone*'
```

You can define your own metadata to use within your own company. The following suggestions are recommendations. .
