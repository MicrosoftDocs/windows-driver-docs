# Room Correction


Windows Vista provides a new feature called room correction processing. This form of processing optimizes the listening experience for a particular location in the room, for example, the center cushion of your couch, by automatically calculating the optimal combination of delay, frequency response, and gain adjustments.

The room correction feature better matches sound to the image on the video screen and is also useful in cases where desktop speakers are placed in nonstandard locations. room correction processing is an improvement over similar features in high-end receivers because it better accounts for the way in which the human ear processes sound.

Calibration is performed with the help of a microphone, and the procedure can be used with both stereo and multichannel systems. The user places the microphone where the user intends to sit and then activates a wizard that measures the room response. The wizard plays a set of specially designed tones from each loudspeaker in turn, and measures the distance, frequency response, and overall gain of each loudspeaker from the microphone's location.
