# Audio Processing Objects Utility Functions

Audio processing objects must have real-time compatibility. This means that all buffers set aside for use by the audio processing interfaces and methods must be nonpageable. The real-time compatibility requirement also means that all code and data in the process path must also be nonpageable.

The following utility functions allocate or release locked memory for use by the interfaces and methods that perform audio processing.

[**AERT\_Allocate**](/windows/win32/api/baseaudioprocessingobject/nf-baseaudioprocessingobject-aert_allocate)

[**AERT\_Free**](/windows/win32/api/baseaudioprocessingobject/nf-baseaudioprocessingobject-aert_free)

The following utility functions are used to create media types for audio data processing.

[**CreateAudioMediaType**](/windows/win32/api/audiomediatype/nf-audiomediatype-createaudiomediatype)

[**CreateAudioMediaTypeFromUncompressedAudioFormat**](/windows/win32/api/audiomediatype/nf-audiomediatype-createaudiomediatypefromuncompressedaudioformat)
