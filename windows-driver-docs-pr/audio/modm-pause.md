# MODM\_PAUSE function

WINMM sends the `MODM_PAUSE` message to the [**modMessage**](mod-message.md) function of a MIDI output driver to temporarily pause output requests. Playback of streams stops but no buffers are marked as done.

## Syntax

``` c++
DWORD modMessage(
   UINT      uDeviceID,
   UINT      uMsg,
   DWORD_PTR dwUser,
   DWORD_PTR dwParam1,
   DWORD_PTR dwParam2
);
```

## Parameters

- *uDeviceID*  
  Specifies the ID of the target device. Device IDs are sequential and have an initial value of zero and a final value that is equal to one less than the number of devices that the driver supports.

- *uMsg*  
  WINMM sets this parameter to **MODM\_PAUSE** when it calls **modMessage** to process this message.

- *dwUser*  
  Use this parameter to return instance data to the driver. Drivers that support multiple clients can use this instance data to track the client that is associated with the message.

- *dwParam1*  
  Not used.

- *dwParam2*  
  Not used.

## Return value

The **modMessage** function returns MMSYSERR\_NOERROR if the operation was successful. Otherwise, it returns MMSYSERR\_NOTENABLED to indicate that the driver failed to load or initialize.

## Remarks

The driver must halt MIDI playback in the current position. The driver must then turn off all notes that are currently on.
