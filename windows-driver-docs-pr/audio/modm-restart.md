# MODM\_RESTART function

WINMM sends the `MODM_RESTART` message to the [**modMessage**](mod-message.md) function of a MIDI output driver to restart playback after a [**MODM\_PAUSE**](modm-pause.md).

## Syntax

``` c++
DWORD modMessage(
   UINT      uDeviceID,
   UINT      uMsg,
   DWORD_PTR dwUser,
   DWORD_PTR dwParam1,
   DWORD_PTR dwParam2
);
```

## Parameters

- *uDeviceID*  
  Specifies the ID of the target device. Device IDs are sequential and have an initial value of zero and a final value that is equal to one less than the number of devices that the driver supports.

- *uMsg*  
  WINMM sets this parameter to **MODM\_RESTART** when it calls **modMessage** to process this message.

- *dwUser*  
  Use this parameter to return instance data to the driver. Drivers that support multiple clients can use this instance data to track the client that is associated with the message.

- *dwParam1*  
  Not used.

- *dwParam2*  
  Not used.

## Return value

The **modMessage** function returns MMSYSERR\_NOERROR if the operation is successful. Otherwise, it returns MMSYSERR\_NOTENABLED to indicate that the driver failed to load or initialize.

## Remarks

The MIDI output device driver must restart MIDI playback at the current position.

**MODM\_PAUSE** and `MODM_RESTART` message pairs cannot be nested. **MODM\_PAUSE** messages that are received while the driver is already in the paused state must be ignored; playback will start on the first `MODM_RESTART` message that is received regardless of the number of **MODM\_PAUSE** that messages were received. Likewise, `MODM_RESTART` messages that are received while the driver is already in play mode must be ignored. MMSYSERR\_NOERROR must be returned in either case.
