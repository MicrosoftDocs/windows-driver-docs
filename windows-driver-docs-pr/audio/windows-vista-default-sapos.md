# Windows Vista Default sAPOs


With Windows Vista the audio driver does not provide digital audio system effects. All digital signal processing for creating system effects is provided by real-time in-process COM objects called system effects audio processing objects (sAPOs).

Windows Vista provides an **Enhancements** tab with the Sound applet on the Control Panel for configuring these system effects. The sAPOs provided by default with Windows Vista are shown in the following list.

[Bass Boost](bass-boost.md)

[Bass Management](bass-management.md)

[Enhanced Sound for Laptop Computers](enhanced-sound-for-laptop-computers.md)

[Loudness Equalization DSP](loudness-equalization-dsp.md)

[Low Frequency Protection](low-frequency-protection.md)

[Room Correction](room-correction.md)

[Speaker Fill](speaker-fill.md)

[Speaker Phantoming](speaker-phantoming.md)

[Virtual Surround](virtual-surround.md)

[Virtualized Surround Sound over Headphones](virtualized-surround-sound-over-headphones.md)
