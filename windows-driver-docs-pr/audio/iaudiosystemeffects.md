# IAudioSystemEffects


The IAudioSystemEffects interface uses the basic methods that are inherited from **IUnknown**, and must implement an **Initialize** method. The parameters that are passed to this **Initialize** method must be passed directly to the **IAudioProcessingObject::Initialize** method.

Refer to the [**IAudioProcessingObject::Initialize**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff536510) method for information about the structure and the parameters that are required to implement the **IAudioSystemEffects::Initialize** method.
