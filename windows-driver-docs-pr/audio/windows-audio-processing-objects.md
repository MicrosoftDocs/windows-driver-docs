Audio processing objects (APOs), provide customizable software based digital signal processing for Windows audio streams.

This section contains the following topics.

- [Implementing Audio Processing Objects](implementing-audio-processing-objects.md)
- [Implementing Hardware Offloaded APO Effects](implementing-hardware-offloaded-apo-effects.md)

APOs were first introduced in Windows Vista and you may see references to the earlier system APOs - sAPOs.
