# Proprietary Data-Intersection Handlers


## <span id="proprietary_data_intersection_handlers"></span><span id="PROPRIETARY_DATA_INTERSECTION_HANDLERS"></span>


You can overcome the limitations of the default data-intersection handler by writing a proprietary handler for your adapter. A proprietary handler is implemented as the [**IMiniport::DataRangeIntersection**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/portcls/nf-portcls-iminiport-datarangeintersection) method on a miniport driver object. See the sample adapter drivers in the Microsoft Windows Driver Kit (WDK) for examples of **DataRangeIntersection** methods.

A proprietary data-intersection handler can compensate for nonstandard hardware features that cannot be adequately specified in the [**KSDATARANGE\_AUDIO**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ksmedia/ns-ksmedia-ksdatarange_audio) structure. For example, the AC97 sample adapter driver in the WDK manages hardware that can support two or more audio channels during playback, but cannot support mono. The sample's [**DataRangeIntersection**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/portcls/nf-portcls-iminiport-datarangeintersection) method determines whether the data range for the other filter's source pin is limited to mono (that is, **MaximumChannels** &lt; 2). If so, it fails the call by returning STATUS\_NO\_MATCH.

A proprietary data-intersection handler has the option of handling data intersections on some of its pins and allowing the port driver's default data-intersection handler to handle data intersections on the other pins.

The remainder of this section presents guidelines for implementing proprietary data-intersection handlers.
