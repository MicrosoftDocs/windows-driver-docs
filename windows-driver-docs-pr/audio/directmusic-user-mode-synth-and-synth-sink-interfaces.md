# DirectMusic User-Mode Synth and Synth Sink Interfaces

This section describes the DirectMusic user-mode interfaces for synths and synth sinks. As described in [User Mode Versus Kernel Mode](./user-mode-versus-kernel-mode.md), these interfaces can be useful for developing driver code in user mode that can later be ported to kernel mode. For information, see [Synthesizers and Wave Sinks](./synthesizers-and-wave-sinks.md).

This section presents the following two user-mode interfaces:
