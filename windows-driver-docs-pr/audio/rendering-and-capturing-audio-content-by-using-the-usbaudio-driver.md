# Rendering and Capturing Audio Content by Using the USBAudio Driver


## <span id="ddk_rendering_and_capturing_audio_content_by_using_the_usbaudio_driver"></span><span id="DDK_RENDERING_AND_CAPTURING_AUDIO_CONTENT_BY_USING_THE_USBAUDIO_DRIVER"></span>


The following figure shows how the [USBAudio class system driver](kernel-mode-wdm-audio-components.md#usbaudio_class_system_driver) is configured to render and capture audio content. In this figure, the USBAudio driver sprouts pins to represent the terminals on the USB Audio device. Audio components such as KMixer, WDMAud, and DirectSound connect to these pins to render output streams or capture input streams.
