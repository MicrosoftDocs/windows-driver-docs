## <span id="wdm_audio_architecture_basic_concepts"></span><span id="WDM_AUDIO_ARCHITECTURE_BASIC_CONCEPTS"></span>


This section presents the basic architectural concepts of [Windows Driver Model](../kernel/writing-wdm-drivers.md) (WDM) audio drivers. The WDM audio architecture is based on kernel streaming (KS) services and is supported in Microsoft Windows 2000 and later and in Windows Me/98. For information about KS services, see [Kernel Streaming](../stream/kernel-streaming.md).

This section discusses the following topics:
