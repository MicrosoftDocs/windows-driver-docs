# KSRTAUDIO\_BUFFER\_PROPERTY structure


The KSRTAUDIO\_BUFFER\_PROPERTY structure appends a buffer base address and requested buffer size to a [**KSPROPERTY**](../stream/ksproperty-structure.md) structure. This structure is used by the client to request allocation of the audio buffer via [**KSPROPERTY\_RTAUDIO\_BUFFER**](ksproperty-rtaudio-buffer.md).

## Syntax

```cpp
typedef struct {
  KSPROPERTY Property;
  PVOID      BaseAddress;
  ULONG      RequestedBufferSize;
} KSRTAUDIO_BUFFER_PROPERTY, *PKSRTAUDIO_BUFFER_PROPERTY;
```

## Members

**Property**  
A KSPROPERTY structure that the client initializes appropriately prior to calling KSPROPERTY\_RTAUDIO\_BUFFER.

**BaseAddress**  
Specifies the desired buffer base address. Unless the client specifies a base address, this parameter is set to **NULL**.

**RequestedBufferSize**  
Specifies the desired buffer size in bytes. The driver returns the actual size of the allocated buffer in the [**KSRTAUDIO\_BUFFER**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ksmedia/ns-ksmedia-ksrtaudio_buffer) structure that it returns.

## Remarks

The KSPROPERTY\_RTAUDIO\_BUFFER request uses the KSRTAUDIO\_BUFFER\_PROPERTY structure to describe the cyclic buffer that the client requests. The driver returns a KSRTAUDIO\_BUFFER structure to describe the buffer that was actually allocated.

The value that the client writes into the **RequestedBufferSize** member is not binding on the driver. However, the driver must specify a buffer size that is as close as possible to the requested size, taking into account the buffer size constraints on the driver itself. The driver allocates a buffer of a different size if the hardware cannot handle the requested size or the system is low on memory. For example, a driver allocates a buffer no smaller than a memory page, or it rounds the buffer size down to the next whole sample block. Also, if the system is running low on memory, the driver allocates a buffer that is smaller than the requested size.
