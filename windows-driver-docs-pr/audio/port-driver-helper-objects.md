# Port Driver Helper Objects


## <span id="port_driver_helper_objects"></span><span id="PORT_DRIVER_HELPER_OBJECTS"></span>


To reduce the difficulty of developing miniport drivers, the PortCls system driver and its built-in port drivers provide a number of helper objects for use by miniport drivers. These objects help miniport drivers to manage DMA channels, resource lists, registry keys, interrupt service calls, and interrupt synchronization.

This section discusses the following topics:

[DMA Channel Objects](dma-channel-objects.md)

[Registry Key Objects](registry-key-objects.md)

[Resource List Objects](resource-list-objects.md)

[Service Sink and Service Group Objects](service-sink-and-service-group-objects.md)

[Interrupt Sync Objects](interrupt-sync-objects.md)
