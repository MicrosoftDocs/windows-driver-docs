## <span id="ddk__devnode_dbg"></span><span id="DDK__DEVNODE_DBG"></span>Parameters


<span id="_______Address______"></span><span id="_______address______"></span><span id="_______ADDRESS______"></span> *Address*   
Specifies the hexadecimal address of the device extension whose node is to be displayed. If this is zero, the root of the main device tree is displayed.

<span id="_______Flags______"></span><span id="_______flags______"></span><span id="_______FLAGS______"></span> *Flags*   
Specifies the level of output to be displayed. This can be any combination of the following bits:

<span id="Bit_0__0x1_"></span><span id="bit_0__0x1_"></span><span id="BIT_0__0X1_"></span>Bit 0 (0x1)  
Causes the display to include all children of the device node.

<span id="Bit_1__0x2_"></span><span id="bit_1__0x2_"></span><span id="BIT_1__0X2_"></span>Bit 1 (0x2)  
Causes the display to include resources used (CM\_RESOURCE\_LIST). These include the boot configuration reported by IRP\_MN\_QUERY\_RESOURCES, as well as the resources allocated to the device in the *AllocatedResources* parameter of IRP\_MN\_START\_DEVICE.

<span id="Bit_2__0x4_"></span><span id="bit_2__0x4_"></span><span id="BIT_2__0X4_"></span>Bit 2 (0x4)  
Causes the display to include resources required (IO\_RESOURCE\_REQUIREMENTS\_LIST) as reported by IRP\_MN\_FILTER\_RESOURCE\_REQUIREMENTS.

<span id="Bit_3__0x8_"></span><span id="bit_3__0x8_"></span><span id="BIT_3__0X8_"></span>Bit 3 (0x8)  
Causes the display to include a list of translated resources as allocated to the device in the *AllocatedResourcesTranslated* parameter of IRP\_MN\_START\_DEVICE.

<span id="Bit_4__0x10_"></span><span id="bit_4__0x10_"></span><span id="BIT_4__0X10_"></span>Bit 4 (0x10)  
Specifies that only device nodes that are not started should be displayed.

<span id="Bit_5__0x20_"></span><span id="bit_5__0x20_"></span><span id="BIT_5__0X20_"></span>Bit 5 (0x20)  
Specifies that only device nodes with problems should be displayed. (These are nodes that contain the flag bits DNF\_HAS\_PROBLEM or DNF\_HAS\_PRIVATE\_PROBLEM.)

<span id="_______Service______"></span><span id="_______service______"></span><span id="_______SERVICE______"></span> *Service*   
Specifies the name of a service. If this is included, only those device nodes driven by this service will be displayed. (If *Flags* includes bit 0x1, device nodes driven by this service and all their children will be displayed.)
