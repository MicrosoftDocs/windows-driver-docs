# !drvobj


The **!drvobj** extension displays detailed information about a DRIVER\_OBJECT.

```dbgcmd
!drvobj DriverObject [Flags] 
```

## <span id="ddk__drvobj_dbg"></span><span id="DDK__DRVOBJ_DBG"></span>Parameters


<span id="_______DriverObject______"></span><span id="_______driverobject______"></span><span id="_______DRIVEROBJECT______"></span> *DriverObject*   
Specifies the driver object. This can be the hexadecimal address of the DRIVER\_OBJECT structure or the name of the driver.

<span id="_______Flags______"></span><span id="_______flags______"></span><span id="_______FLAGS______"></span> *Flags*   
Can be any combination of the following bits. (The default is 0x01.)

<span id="Bit_0__0x1_"></span><span id="bit_0__0x1_"></span><span id="BIT_0__0X1_"></span>Bit 0 (0x1)  
Causes the display to include device objects owned by the driver.

<span id="Bit_1__0x2_"></span><span id="bit_1__0x2_"></span><span id="BIT_1__0X2_"></span>Bit 1 (0x2)  
Causes the display to include entry points for the driver's dispatch routines.

<span id="Bit_2__0x4_"></span><span id="bit_2__0x4_"></span><span id="BIT_2__0X4_"></span>Bit 2 (0x4)  
Lists with detailed information the device objects owned by the driver (requires bit 0 (0x1)).

## DLL

Kdexts.dll


## Additional Information

See [Plug and Play Debugging](../debugger/plug-and-play-debugging.md) for examples and applications of this extension command. For information about driver objects, see the Windows Driver Kit (WDK) documentation and *Microsoft Windows Internals* by Mark Russinovich and David Solomon.

## Remarks

If *DriverObject* specifies the name of the device but supplies no prefix, the prefix "\\Driver\\" is assumed. Note that this command will check to see if *DriverObject* is a valid address or device name before using the expression evaluator.

If *DriverObject* is an address, it must be the address of the DRIVER\_OBJECT structure. This can be obtained by examining the arguments passed to the driver's **DriverEntry** routine.

This extension command will display a list of all device objects created by a specified driver. It will also display all fast I/O routines registered with this driver object.

The following is an example for the Symbios Logic 810 SCSI miniport driver:

```dbgcmd
kd> bp DriverEntry          //  breakpoint at DriverEntry

kd> g
symc810!DriverEntry+0x40:    
80006a20: b07e0050 stl     t2,50(sp)

kd> r a0  //address of DevObj (the first parameter)
a0=809d5550

kd> !drvobj 809d5550   //  display the driver object
Driver object is for:
\Driver\symc810
Device Object list:
809d50d0
```

You can also use [**!devobj 809d50d0**](-devobj.md) to get information about the device object.
