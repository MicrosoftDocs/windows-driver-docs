# .writemem (Write Memory to File)

The **.writemem** command writes a section of memory to a file.

```dbgcmd
.writemem FileName Range 
```

## Parameters

<span id="_______FileName______"></span><span id="_______filename______"></span><span id="_______FILENAME______"></span> *FileName*   
Specifies the name of the file to be created. You can specify a full path and file name, or just the file name. If the file name contains spaces, *FileName* should be enclosed in quotation marks. If no path is specified, the current directory is used.

<span id="_______Range______"></span><span id="_______range______"></span><span id="_______RANGE______"></span> *Range*   
Specifies the memory range to be written to the file. For syntax details, see [Address and Address Range Syntax](address-and-address-range-syntax.md).

## Remarks

The memory is copied literally to the file. It is not parsed in any way.

The **.writemem** command is the opposite of the [**.readmem (Read Memory from File)**](-readmem--read-memory-from-file-.md) command.
