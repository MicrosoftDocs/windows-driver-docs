Specifies the thread or threads to resume. For more information about the syntax, see [Thread Syntax](thread-syntax.md).

|--------|----------------------|
|Modes | user mode only |
|Targets | live debugging only |
|Platforms | all  |

## Additional Information

For more information about the suspend count and how suspended threads behave and for a list of other commands that control the suspending and freezing of threads, see [Controlling Processes and Threads](../debugger/controlling-processes-and-threads.md).

## Remarks

You can specify threads only in user mode. In kernel mode, the tilde (~) refers to a processor.

Every time that you use the **~m** command, the thread's suspend count is decreased by one.
