# !devext


The **!devext** extension displays bus-specific device extension information for devices on a variety of buses.

```dbgcmd
!devext Address TypeCode
```

## <span id="ddk__devext_dbg"></span><span id="DDK__DEVEXT_DBG"></span>Parameters

###  *Address*   
Specifies the hexadecimal address of the device extension to be displayed.

#### *TypeCode*   
Specifies the type of object that owns the device extension to be displayed. Type codes are not case-sensitive. Valid type codes are:

|TypeCode|Object|
|--- |--- |
|ISAPNP|ISA PnP device extension|
|PCMCIA|PCMCIA device extension|
|HID|HID device extension|
 

## DLL

Kdexts.dll
 

## Additional Information

See [Plug and Play Debugging](../debugger/plug-and-play-debugging.md) for applications of this extension command. For more information about device extensions, see the Windows Driver Kit (WDK) documentation.

## Remarks

The **!usbhub**, **!hidfdo**, and **!hidpdo** extensions are obsolete; their functionality has been integrated into **!devext**.

For those object types that are no longer supported by **!devext**, use the [**dt (Display Type)**](dt--display-type-.md) debugger command.

Here is an example for an ISA PnP device extension:

```dbgcmd
kd> !devext e0000165fff32190 ISAPNP
ISA PnP FDO @ 0x00000000, DevExt @ 0xe0000165fff32190, Bus # 196639

                    DF_STOPPED, DF_RESTARTED_NOMOVE, 
                    DF_BUS
                    Unknown flags 0x054e2000

```

Here is an example for a PCI device:

```dbgcmd
