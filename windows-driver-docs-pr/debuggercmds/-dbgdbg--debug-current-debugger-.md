```

## Environment

|  Item  | Description          |
|--------|----------------------|
|Modes   |User mode, kernel mode|
|Targets |Live, crash dump      |
|Platforms|All                  |

 

## Remarks

The **.dbgdbg** command is similar to the [**CTRL+P (Debug Current Debugger)**](../debugger/ctrl-p--debug-current-debugger-.md) control key. However, **.dbgdbg** is more versatile, because it can be used from WinDbg as well as KD and CDB, and it can be used to debug a debugging server on a remote computer.
