Causes all currently loaded symbols to be included in the CAB file. For minidumps, all loaded images will be included as well. Use [**lml**](lm--list-loaded-modules-.md) to determine which symbols and images are loaded.

<span id="_______CabName______"></span><span id="_______cabname______"></span><span id="_______CABNAME______"></span> *CabName*   
The CAB file name, including extension. *CabName* can include an absolute or relative path; relative paths are relative to the directory in which the debugger was started. It is recommended that you choose the extension .cab.

## Additional Information

For more details on crash dumps, see [Crash Dump Files](../debugger/crash-dump-files.md).

## Remarks

This command can only be used if you are already debugging a dump file.

If you are debugging a live target and want to create a dump file and place it in a CAB, you should use the [**.dump (Create Dump File)**](-dump--create-dump-file-.md) command. Next, start a new debugging session with the dump file as its target, and use **.dumpcab**.

The **.dumpcab** command cannot be used to place multiple dump files into one CAB file.
