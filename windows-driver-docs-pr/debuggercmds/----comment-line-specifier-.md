# \* (Comment Line Specifier)

If the asterisk ( `*` ) character is at the start of a command, then the rest of the line is treated as a comment, even if a semicolon appears after it.

```dbgcmd
    * [any text]
```

## Remarks

The `*` token is parsed like any other debugger command. Therefore, if you want to create a comment after another command, you must precede the `*` token with a semicolon.

The `*` token will cause the remainder of the line to be ignored, even if a semicolon appears after it. This differs from [\$\$ (Comment Specifier)](-----comment-specifier-.md), which creates a comment that can be terminated by a semicolon.

For example, the following command will display eax and ebx, but not ecx:

```console
0:000> r eax; $$ some text; r ebx; * more text; r ecx
```

Text prefixed by the `*` or `$$` tokens is not processed in any way. If you are performing remote debugging, a comment entered in the debugging server will not be visible in the debugging client, nor vice-versa. If you wish to make comment text appear in the Debugger Command window in a way visible to all parties, you should use [.echo (Echo Comment)](-echo--echo-comment-.md).
