# SCSI Miniport Extensions (Scsikd.dll and Minipkd.dll)


Extension commands that are useful for debugging SCSI miniport drivers can be found in Scsikd.dll and Minipkd.dll.

You can use the Scsikd.dll extension commands with any version of Windows. However, you can only use the Minipkd.dll extension commands with Windows XP and later versions of Windows. Commands in Minipkd.dll are only applicable to SCSIport-based miniports.

For more information, see [SCSI Miniport Debugging](../debugger/scsi-miniport-debugging.md).
