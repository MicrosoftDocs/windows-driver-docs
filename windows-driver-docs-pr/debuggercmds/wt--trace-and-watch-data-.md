# wt (Trace and Watch Data)


The **wt** command runs through the whole function and then displays statistics, when you execute this command at the beginning of a function call.

```dbgcmd
wt [WatchOptions] [= StartAddress] [EndAddress] 
```

<span id="_______StartAddress______"></span><span id="_______startaddress______"></span><span id="_______STARTADDRESS______"></span> *StartAddress*   
Specifies the address where the debugger begins execution. If you do not use *StartAddress*, execution begins at the instruction that the instruction pointer points to. For more information about the syntax, see [Address and Address Range Syntax](address-and-address-range-syntax.md).

<span id="_______EndAddress______"></span><span id="_______endaddress______"></span><span id="_______ENDADDRESS______"></span> *EndAddress*   
Specifies the address where tracing ends. If you do not use *EndAddress*, a single instruction or function call is executed.

## Additional Information

For more information about issuing the **wt** command and an overview of related commands, see [Controlling the Target](../debugger/controlling-the-target.md).

## Remarks

The **wt** command is useful if you want information about the behavior of a specific function, but you do not want to step through the function. Instead, go to the beginning of that function and then issue the **wt** command.

If the program counter is at a point that corresponds to a symbol (such as the beginning of a function or entry point into a module), the **wt** command traces until it reaches the current return address. If the program counter is on a **call** instruction, the **wt** command traces until it returns to the current location. This tracing is profiled in the [Debugger Command window](../debugger/debugger-command-window.md) together with output that describes the various calls that the command encounters.

If the **wt** command is issued somewhere other than the beginning of a function, the command behaves like the [**p (Step)**](p--step-.md) command. However, if you specify *EndAddress*, execution continues until that address is reached, even if this execution involves many program steps and function calls.

When you are debugging in source mode, you should trace into the function only to the point where you see the opening bracket of the function body. Then, you can use the **wt** command. (It is typically easier to insert a breakpoint at the first line of the function, or use **Debug | Run to Cursor**, and then use the **wt** command.)

Because the output from **wt** can be long, you might want to use a log file to record your output.

The following example shows a typical log file.

```dbgcmd
0:000> l+                  Source options set to show source lines
Source options are f:
     1/t - Step/trace by source line
     2/l - List source line for LN and prompt
     4/s - List source code at prompt
     8/o - Only show source code at prompt
0:000> p                   Not yet at the function call: use "p"

0:000> p
>  45:       variableOne = myFunction(2, minorVariable);
0:000> t                   At the function call: now use "t"

23 system calls were executed

Calls  System Call

```

In the listing of the trace, the first number specifies the number of instructions that were executed, the second number specifies the number of instructions executed by child processes of the function, and the third number (in brackets) specifies the depth of the function in the stack (taking the initial function as zero). The indentation of the function name shows the call depth.

In the preceding example, **MyModule!myFunction** executes 105 instructions before it calls several subroutines, including **printf** and **fgets**, and then executes 54545 additional instructions after calling those functions, but before issuing a few more calls. However, in the final count, the display shows that **myFunction** executes 112,379 instructions, because this count includes all of the instructions that **myFunction** and its children execute. (The *children* of **myFunction** are functions that are called from **myFunction**, either directly or indirectly.)

In the preceding example, note also that **ILT+1440 (\_\_isatty)** is called 21 times. In the final count, the summary of this function's behavior shows the number of times that it was called, the smallest number of instructions in any single execution, the largest number of instructions in any single execution, and the average number of instructions per execution.

If any system calls are made, they appear in the counter and are listed again at the end of the command output.
