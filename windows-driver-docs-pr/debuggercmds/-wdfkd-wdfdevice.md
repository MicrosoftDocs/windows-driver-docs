# !wdfkd.wdfdevice

The **!wdfkd.wdfdevice** extension displays information that is associated with a WDFDEVICE-typed object handle.

```dbgcmd
!wdfkd.wdfdevice Handle [Flags]
```

## Parameters

<span id="_______Handle______"></span><span id="_______handle______"></span><span id="_______HANDLE______"></span> *Handle*   
A handle to a WDFDEVICE-typed object.

<span id="_______Flags______"></span><span id="_______flags______"></span><span id="_______FLAGS______"></span> *Flags*   
Optional. The kind of information to display. *Flags* can be any combination of the following bits:

<span id="Bit_0__0x1_"></span><span id="bit_0__0x1_"></span><span id="BIT_0__0X1_"></span>Bit 0 (0x1)  
The display will include verbose information about the device, such as the associated WDFCHILDLIST-typed handles, synchronization scope, and execution level.

<span id="Bit_1__0x2_"></span><span id="bit_1__0x2_"></span><span id="BIT_1__0X2_"></span>Bit 1 (0x2)  
The display will include detailed power state information.

<span id="Bit_2__0x4_"></span><span id="bit_2__0x4_"></span><span id="BIT_2__0X4_"></span>Bit 2 (0x4)  
The display will include detailed power policy state information.

<span id="Bit_3__0x8_"></span><span id="bit_3__0x8_"></span><span id="BIT_3__0X8_"></span>Bit 3 (0x8)  
The display will include detailed Plug and Play (PnP) state information.

<span id="Bit_4__0x10_"></span><span id="bit_4__0x10_"></span><span id="BIT_4__0X10_"></span>Bit 4 (0x10)  
The display will include the device object's callback functions.

## DLL

Wdfkd.dll

### Frameworks

KMDF 1, UMDF 2

## Additional Information

For more information, see [Kernel-Mode Driver Framework Debugging](../debugger/kernel-mode-driver-framework-debugging.md).

## Remarks

The following example uses the **!wdfkd.wdfdevice** extension on a WDFDEVICE handle that represents a physical device object (PDO), without specifying any flags.

```dbgcmd
kd> !wdfdevice 0x7cad31c8 

# Dumping WDFDEVICE 0x7cad31c8
=================================

WDM PDEVICE_OBJECTs:  self 81fb00e8

Pnp state:  119 ( WdfDevStatePnpStarted )
Power state:  31f ( WdfDevStatePowerDx )
Power Pol state:  508 ( WdfDevStatePwrPolWaitingUnarmed )

Parent WDFDEVICE 7ca7b1c0
Parent states:
   Pnp state:  119 ( WdfDevStatePnpStarted )
   Power state:  307 ( WdfDevStatePowerD0 )
   Power Pol state:  565 ( WdfDevStatePwrPolStarted )

No pended pnp or power irps
Device is the power policy owner for the stack
```

The following example displays the same device object as the preceding example, but this time with a flag value of 0xF. This flag value, a combination of the bits 0x1, 0x2, 0x4, and 0x8, causes the display to include verbose device information, power state information, power policy state information, and PnP state information.

```dbgcmd
kd> !wdfdevice 0x7cad31c8 f
