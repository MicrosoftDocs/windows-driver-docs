# !drivers

>[!NOTE] 
> In Windows XP and later versions of Windows, the **!drivers** extension is obsolete. To display information about loaded drivers and other modules, use the [**lm**](lm--list-loaded-modules-.md) command. 
>

The command lm t n displays information in a format very similar to the old **!drivers** extension. However, this command will not display the memory usage of the drivers as the **!drivers** extension did. It will only display the drivers' start and end addresses, image names, and timestamps. The [**!vm**](-vm.md) and [**!memusage**](-memusage.md) extensions can be used to display memory usage statistics.

```dbgcmd
!drivers [Flags]
```

## <span id="ddk__drivers_dbg"></span><span id="DDK__DRIVERS_DBG"></span>Parameters


<span id="_______Flags______"></span><span id="_______flags______"></span><span id="_______FLAGS______"></span> *Flags*   
Can be any combination of the following values. (The default is 0x0.)

<span id="Bit_0__0x1_"></span><span id="bit_0__0x1_"></span><span id="BIT_0__0X1_"></span>Bit 0 (0x1)  
Causes the display to include information about resident and standby memory.

<span id="Bit_1__0x2_"></span><span id="bit_1__0x2_"></span><span id="BIT_1__0X2_"></span>Bit 1 (0x2)  
If this bit is set and bit 2 (0x4) is not set, the display will include information about resident, standby, and locked memory, as well as the loader entry address. If bit 2 is set, this causes the display to be a much longer and more detailed list of the driver image. Information about the headers is included, as is section information.

<span id="Bit_2__0x4_"></span><span id="bit_2__0x4_"></span><span id="BIT_2__0X4_"></span>Bit 2 (0x4)  
Causes the display to be a much longer and more detailed list of the driver image. Information about each section is included. If bit 1 (0x2) is set, this will also include header information.

## Additional Information

See [Plug and Play Debugging](../debugger/plug-and-play-debugging.md) for applications of this extension command. For information about drivers and their memory use, see the Windows Driver Kit (WDK) documentation and *Microsoft Windows Internals* by Mark Russinovich and David Solomon.

## Remarks

An explanation of this command's display is given in the following table:

When the memory address used by the code that causes a stop falls between the base address for a driver and the base address for the next driver in the list, that driver is frequently the cause of the fault.
