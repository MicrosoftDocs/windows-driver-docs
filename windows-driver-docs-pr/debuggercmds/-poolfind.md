# !poolfind

The **!poolfind** extension finds all instances of a specific pool tag in either nonpaged or paged memory pools.

```dbgcmd
!poolfind TagString [PoolType] 
!poolfind TagValue [PoolType] 
```

## Parameters

<span id="_______TagString______"></span><span id="_______tagstring______"></span><span id="_______TAGSTRING______"></span> *TagString*   
Specifies the pool tag. *TagString* is a case-sensitive ASCII string. The asterisk (\*) can be used to represent any number of characters; the question mark (?) can be used to represent exactly one character. Unless an asterisk is used, *TagString* must be exactly four characters in length.

<span id="_______TagValue______"></span><span id="_______tagvalue______"></span><span id="_______TAGVALUE______"></span> *TagValue*   
Specifies the pool tag. *TagValue* must begin with "0x", even if the default radix is 16. If this parameter begins with any other value (including "0X") it will be interpreted as an ASCII tag string.

<span id="_______PoolType______"></span><span id="_______pooltype______"></span><span id="_______POOLTYPE______"></span> *PoolType*   
Specifies the type of pool to be searched. The following values are permitted:

<span id="0"></span>0  
Specifies nonpaged memory pool. This is the default.

<span id="1"></span>1  
Specifies paged memory pool.

<span id="2"></span>2  
Specifies the special pool.

<span id="4"></span>4  
Specifies the session pool.

## DLL

Kdexts.dll

## Additional Information

For information about memory pools and pool tags, see the Windows Driver Kit (WDK) documentation and *Microsoft Windows Internals*, by Mark Russinovich and David Solomon.

## Remarks

This command can take a significant amount of time to execute, depending on the size of pool memory that must be searched. To speed up this execution, increase the COM port speed with the [**CTRL+A (Toggle Baud Rate)**](../debugger/ctrl-a--toggle-baud-rate-.md) key, or use the [**.cache (Set Cache Size)**](-cache--set-cache-size-.md) command to increase the cache size (to approximately 10 MB).

The pool tag is the same tag passed to the **ExAllocate**_Xxx_ family of routines.

Here is an example. The entire nonpaged pool is searched and then the paged pool is searched, but the command is terminated before completion (after an hour of operation):
