## Additional Information

The .scriptlist command will list any scripts which have been loaded via the .scriptload command.

If the TestScript was successfully loaded using .scriptload, the .scriptlist command would display the name of the loaded script.

```dbgcmd

Command Loaded Scripts:
    JavaScript script from 'C:\WinDbg\Scripts\TestScript.js'
```

### Requirements

Before using any of the .script commands, a scripting provider needs to be loaded.
