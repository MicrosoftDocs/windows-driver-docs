The **!ruleinfo** command displays information about a Driver Verifier rule.

```dbgcmd

```

## Parameters

<span id="_______RuleId______"></span><span id="_______ruleid______"></span><span id="_______RULEID______"></span> *RuleId*   
The ID of the verifier rule. This is the first argument of the [**DRIVER\_VERIFIER\_DETECTED\_VIOLATION**](../debugger/bug-check-0xc4--driver-verifier-detected-violation.md) bug check.

<span id="_______RuleState______"></span><span id="_______rulestate______"></span><span id="_______RULESTATE______"></span> *RuleState*   
Additional state information about the violation. This is the third argument of the **DRIVER\_VERIFIER\_DETECTED\_VIOLATION** bug check.

<span id="_______SubState______"></span><span id="_______substate______"></span><span id="_______SUBSTATE______"></span> *SubState*   
Sub-state information about the violation. This is the fourth argument of the **DRIVER\_VERIFIER\_DETECTED\_VIOLATION** bug check.

## DLL

ext.dll

## Remarks

This command applies only to rules in the Driver Verifier extension; that is, rules that have an ID greater than or equal to 0x10000.

The following example shows the four arguments of a [**DRIVER\_VERIFIER\_DETECTED\_VIOLATION**](../debugger/bug-check-0xc4--driver-verifier-detected-violation.md) bug check.

```dbgcmd
DRIVER_VERIFIER_DETECTED_VIOLATION (c4)
...
Arguments:
Arg1: 0000000000091001, ID of the 'NdisOidComplete' rule that was violated.
Arg2: fffff800002d49d0, A pointer to the string describing the violated rule condition.
Arg3: ffffe000027b8370, Address of internal rule state (second argument to !ruleinfo).
Arg4: ffffe000027b83f8, Address of supplemental states (third argument to !ruleinfo).

## Debugging Details:


DV_VIOLATED_CONDITION:  This OID should only be completed with NDIS_STATUS_NOT_ACCEPTED,

In the preceding output, the rule ID (0x91001) is shown as Arg1. Arg3 and Arg4 are the addresses of rule state and substate information. You can pass the rule ID, the rule state, and the substate to **!ruleinfo** to get a description of the rule and a link to detailed documentation of the rule.

```dbgcmd
3: kd> !ruleinfo 0x91001 0xffffe000027b8370 0xffffe000027b83f8

RULE_ID: 0x91001
