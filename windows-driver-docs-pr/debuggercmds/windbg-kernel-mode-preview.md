This topic describes how to start a kernel mode session with WinDbg.

The process is very similar to how it has been done with previous versions of WinDbg. Select the tab for the type of transport you're using, fill in the required fields, and click OK.

The *Paste* tab allows you to paste in custom connection strings.
