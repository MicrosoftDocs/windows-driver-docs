# .wtitle (Set Window Title)

The **.wtitle** command sets the title in the main WinDbg window or in the NTSD, CDB, or KD window.

```dbgcmd

```

The title to use for the window.

## Environment

This command cannot be used in script files.

## Remarks

For CDB, NTSD, or KD, if the **.wtitle** command has not been used, the window title matches the command line used to launch the debugger.

For WinDbg, if **.wtitle** has not been used, the main window title includes the name of the target. If a debugging server is active, its connection string is displayed as well. If multiple debugging servers are active, only the most recent one is displayed.

When **.wtitle** is used, *Title* replaces all this information. Even if a debugging server is started later, *Title* will not change.

The WinDbg version number is always displayed in the window title bar, regardless of whether this command is used.
