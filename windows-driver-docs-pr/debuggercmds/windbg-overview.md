# What is WinDbg?

WinDbg is the latest version of WinDbg with more modern visuals, faster windows, a full-fledged scripting experience, built with the extensible debugger data model front and center.

> [!NOTE]
> Formerly released as *WinDbg Preview* in the Microsoft Store, *WinDbg* leverages the same underlying engine as *WinDbg (Classic)* and supports all the same commands, extensions, and workflows.

## General features

- **Connection setup and recall** - Recent targets and session configurations are saved. They can be quickly restarted from the file menu.

    :::image type="content" source="images/windbgx-start-debugging-menu.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the start debugging menu in WinDbg debugger.":::

- **Dark theme** - Go to File > Settings to enable the dark theme.

    :::image type="content" source="images/windbgx-dark-theme.png" alt-text="Screenshot of WinDbg debugger with dark theme enabled.":::

- **Keyboard navigation** - Use Ctrl+Tab to easily navigate between windows with just your keyboard.

    :::image type="content" source="images/windbgx-ctrl-tab.gif" alt-text="Screenshot demonstrating the Ctrl+Tab menu in WinDbg debugger.":::

- **Dump file processor detection** - Autodetects processor architecture for easier managed debugging.

- **Performance improvements** - Tool windows load asynchronously and can be canceled. When you run a command, WinDbg can stop the loading of your locals, watch, or other windows.

## Start debugging view

- **Integrated Time Travel Debugging (TTD)** - Use the "Record with Time Travel Debugging" checkbox when launching or attaching to a process. WinDbg will set up TTD, start recording, and open the trace afterwards.

    For more information, see [Time Travel Debugging - Overview](time-travel-debugging-overview.md).

    :::image type="content" source="images/windbgx-ttd.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the process record menu in WinDbg with a Notepad process selected for recording.":::

- **Launch App packages** - Debug your universal app or background task in a single click.

    For more information, see [Launch App Package](./windbg-user-mode-preview.md#launch-app-package).

    :::image type="content" source="images/windbgx-launch-app-package.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Launch App Package Applications tab in WinDbg with 'cal' in the search box and three apps listed.":::

- **Attach to a process** - The new attach view provides a detailed view of running processes, easier configuration, and search support.

## Improved tool windows

- **Command** - The command window has improved DML support, text highlighting, search (including Regex).

    :::image type="content" source="images/windbgx-highlighting.gif" alt-text="Screenshot of the command window in WinDbg with columns highlighted in yellow.":::

- **Source** - The source code window provides syntax highlighting and other general improvements similar to most modern text editors.

    :::image type="content" source="images/windbgx-source-window.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the source code window in WinDbg debugger with syntax highlighting.":::

- **Disassembly** - The disassembly window is also improved, the highlight of the current instruction remains where it's when you scroll.

    :::image type="content" source="images/windbgx-disassembly.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the disassembly window in WinDbg debugger.":::

- **Breakpoints** - The breakpoints window shows all your current breakpoints, a one-click toggle, and a hit count.

    For more information, see [Breakpoints](windbg-breakpoints-preview.md).

    :::image type="content" source="images/windbgx-breakpoints-window.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the breakpoint window in WinDbg debugger showing current breakpoints.":::

- **Scripting** - The new scripting window makes developing JavaScript and NatVis extensions easier, with error highlighting and IntelliSense.

    For more information, see [WinDbg - Scripting](windbg-scripting-preview.md).

    :::image type="content" source="images/windbgx-scripting-intellisense.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the scripting window in WinDbg debugger with IntelliSense and error highlighting.":::

- **Data model** - The model window provides an expandable and browsable version of `dx` and `dx -g`, letting you create powerful tables on-top of your NatVis, JavaScript, and LINQ queries.

    For more information, see [WinDbg - Data model](windbg-data-model-preview.md).

    :::image type="content" source="images/windbgx-data-model-explore-window.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the data model window in WinDbg debugger with expandable and browsable features.":::

- **Locals and watch** - The locals and watch windows are both based off the data model that is used by the `dx` command. This means they benefit from the same features as other data model windows.

- **Memory** - The memory window has highlighting and improved scrolling.

- **Logs** - This is an under the covers log of the WinDbg internals. It can be viewed for troubleshooting or to monitor long running commands.
