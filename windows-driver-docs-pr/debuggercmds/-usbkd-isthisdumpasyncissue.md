# !usbkd.isthisdumpasyncissue


The **!usbkd.isthisdumpasyncissue** command checks a crash dump file, generated by [**Bug Check 0xFE**](../debugger/bug-check-0xfe--bugcode-usb-driver.md), to see whether the likely cause of the crash was an Interrupt on Async Advance issue associated with a USB EHCI host controller.

```dbgcmd
!usbkd.isthisdumpasyncissue
```

## DLL

Usbkd.dll

## Remarks

Use this command only when you are debugging a crash dump file that was generated as a result of [**Bug Check 0xFE: BUGCODE\_USB\_DRIVER**](../debugger/bug-check-0xfe--bugcode-usb-driver.md).

## Examples

Here is an example of the output of **!usbkd.isthisdumpasyncissue**.

```dbgcmd
1: kd> !analyze -v
*** ...
BUGCODE_USB_DRIVER (fe) 
...
1: kd> !usbkd.isthisdumpasyncissue
This is *NOT* Async on Advance Issue because the EndPointData is NULL
```
