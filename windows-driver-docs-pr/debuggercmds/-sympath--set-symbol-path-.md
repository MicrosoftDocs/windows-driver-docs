# .sympath (Set Symbol Path)

The **.sympath** command sets or alters the symbol path. The symbol path specifies locations where the debugger looks for symbol files.

```dbgcmd
.sympath[+] [Path [; ...]]
```

## Parameters

<span id="______________"></span> **+**   
Specifies that the new locations will be appended to (rather than replace) the previous symbol search path.

<span id="_______Path______"></span><span id="_______path______"></span><span id="_______PATH______"></span> *Path*   
A fully qualified path or a list of fully qualified paths. Multiple paths are separated by semicolons. If *Path* is omitted, the current symbol path is displayed.

## Additional Information

For details and other ways to change this path, see [Symbol Path](../debugger/symbol-path.md).
