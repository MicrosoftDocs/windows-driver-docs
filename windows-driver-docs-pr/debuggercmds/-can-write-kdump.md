# !can\_write\_kdump


The **!can\_write\_kdump** extension verifies that there is enough disk space on the target computer to write a kernel dump file of the specified type.

```dbgsyntax
!can_write_kdump [-dn] [Options]
```

## Parameters


<span id="_______-dn______"></span><span id="_______-DN______"></span> **-dn**   
Specifies that the file system on the target computer is an NTFS file system. If this parameter is omitted, then the amount of disk free space cannot be determined, and a warning will be shown. However, the amount of space required will still be displayed.

*Options*
The following options are valid:

<span id="-t"></span><span id="-T"></span>**-t**  
Specifies that the extension should determine if there is enough space for a minidump.

<span id="-s"></span><span id="-S"></span>**-s**  
Specifies that the extension should determine if there is enough space for a summary kernel dump. This is the default value.

<span id="-f"></span><span id="-F"></span>**-f**  
Specifies that the extension should determine if there is enough space for a full kernel dump.
