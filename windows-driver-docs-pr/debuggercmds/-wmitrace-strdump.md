# !wmitrace.strdump

The **!wmitrace.strdump** extension displays the WMI event trace structures. You can limit the display to the structures for a particular trace session.

```dbgcmd
!wmitrace.strdump [ LoggerID | LoggerName ] 
```

## Parameters

<span id="_______LoggerID______"></span><span id="_______loggerid______"></span><span id="_______LOGGERID______"></span> *LoggerID*   
Limits the display to the event trace structures for the specified trace session. *LoggerID* specifies the trace session. It is an ordinal number that the system assigns to each trace session on the computer. If no parameter is specified, all trace sessions are displayed.

<span id="_______LoggerName______"></span><span id="_______loggername______"></span><span id="_______LOGGERNAME______"></span> *LoggerName*   
Limits the display to the event trace structures for the specified trace session. *LoggerName* is the text name that was specified when the trace session was started. If no parameter is specified, all trace sessions are displayed.

## DLL

Wmitrace.dll

This extension is available in Windows 2000 and later versions of Windows. If you want to use this extension with Windows 2000, you must first copy the Wmitrace.dll file from the winxp subdirectory of the Debugging Tools for Windows installation directory to the w2kfre subdirectory.

## Additional Information
