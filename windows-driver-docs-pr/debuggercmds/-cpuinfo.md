```dbgsyntax

```

## <span id="ddk__cpuinfo_dbg"></span><span id="DDK__CPUINFO_DBG"></span>Parameters


<span id="_______Processor______"></span><span id="_______processor______"></span><span id="_______PROCESSOR______"></span> *Processor*

## DLL

## Additional Information

For more information about debugging multiprocessor computers, see [Multiprocessor Syntax](multiprocessor-syntax.md).

## Remarks

The **!cpuinfo** extension command can be used when performing [local kernel debugging](../debugger/performing-local-kernel-debugging.md).

Here is an example generated by an x86-based processor:

```dbgcmd
kd> !cpuinfo
CP F/M/S Manufacturer  MHz Update Signature Features 
 0 6,1,9 GenuineIntel  198 000000d200000000 000000ff 
```

The **CP** column indicates the processor number. The **Manufacturer** column specifies the processor manufacturer. The **MHz** or **Speed** column specifies the speed, in MHz, of the processor, if it is available.

For an x86-based processor or an x64-based processor, the **F** column displays the processor family number, the **M** column displays the processor model number, and the **S** column displays the stepping size.

Other columns will also appear, depending on your machine's specific architecture.

For details on how to interpret specific values for each entry, as well as any additional columns, consult the processor manual.
