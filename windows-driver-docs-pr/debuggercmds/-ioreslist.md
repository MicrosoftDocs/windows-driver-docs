```

## Parameters

<span id="_______Address______"></span><span id="_______address______"></span><span id="_______ADDRESS______"></span> *Address*   
Specifies the hexadecimal address of the IO\_RESOURCE\_REQUIREMENTS\_LIST structure.

### DLL

The IO\_RESOURCE\_REQUIREMENTS\_LIST contains information about:

-   Resource types

    There are four types of resources: I/O, Memory, IRQ, DMA.

-   Descriptors

    Each preferred setting has a "Preferred" descriptor and a number of "Alternative" descriptors.

This resource list contains the following requests:

-   I/O Ranges

    Prefers a range of 0x1000 to 0x10FF inclusive, but can use any 0x100 range between 0 and 0xFFFFFFFF, provided it is 0x100-aligned. (For example, 0x1100 to 0x11FF is acceptable.)

-   Memory

    Prefers a range of 0x40080000 to 0x40080FFF, but can use any range that is of size 0x1000, is 0x1000-aligned, and is located between 0 and 0xFFFFFFFF.

-   IRQ

    Must use IRQ 0xB.

Interrupts and DMA channels are represented as ranges with the same beginning and end.
