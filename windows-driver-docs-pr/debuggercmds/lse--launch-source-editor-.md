## Remarks

The **lse** command opens an editor for the current source file. This command is equivalent to clicking **Edit this file** in the shortcut menu of the [Source window](../debugger/source-window.md) in WinDbg.

The editor is opened on the computer that the target is running on, so you cannot use the **lse** command from a remote client.

The WinDiff editor registry information or the value of the WINDBG\_INVOKE\_EDITOR environment variable determine which editor is opened. For example, consider the following value of WINDBG\_INVOKE\_EDITOR.

```reg
c:\my\path\myeditor.exe -file %f -line %l
```

This value indicates that Myeditor.exe opens to the one-based line number of the current source file. The **%l** option indicates that line numbers should be read as one-based, and **%f** indicates that the current source file should be used. You could also include **%L** to indicate that line numbers are zero-based or **%p** to indicate that the current source file should be used.
