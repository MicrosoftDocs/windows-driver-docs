## Additional Information

For more information about the command shell and for other ways to disable shell commands, see [Using Shell Commands](using-shell-commands.md).

## Remarks

If you use the **.noshell** command, you cannot use [**.shell (Command Shell)**](-shell--command-shell-.md) commands as long as the debugger is running, even if you start a new debugging session.

If you are performing remote debugging, this command is useful for security purposes.
