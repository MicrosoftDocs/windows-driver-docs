# .else


The **.else** token behaves like the **else** keyword in C.

```dbgcmd
.if (Condition) { Commands } .else { Commands } 

.if (Condition) { Commands } .elsif (Condition) { Commands } .else { Commands } 
```

<span id="_______Commands______"></span><span id="_______commands______"></span><span id="_______COMMANDS______"></span> *Commands*   
Specifies one or more commands that will be executed conditionally. This block of commands needs to be enclosed in braces, even if it consists of a single command. Multiple commands should be separated by semicolons, but the final command before the closing brace does not need to be followed by a semicolon.

## Additional Information

For information about other control flow tokens and their use in debugger command programs, see [Using Debugger Command Programs](../debugger/using-debugger-command-programs.md).
