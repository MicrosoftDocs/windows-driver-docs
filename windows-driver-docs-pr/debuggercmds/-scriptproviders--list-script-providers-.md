## Additional Information

The .scriptproviders command will list all the script languages which are presently understood by the debugger and the extension under which they are registered. Any file ending in ".NatVis" is understood as a NatVis script and any file ending in ".js" is understood as a JavaScript script. Either type of script can be loaded with the .scriptload command.

In the example below, the JavaScript and NatVis providers are loaded.

```dbgcmd
0:000> .scriptproviders
Available Script Providers:
    NatVis (extension '.NatVis')
    JavaScript (extension '.js')
```

### Requirements

Before using any of the .script commands, a scripting provider needs to be loaded.
