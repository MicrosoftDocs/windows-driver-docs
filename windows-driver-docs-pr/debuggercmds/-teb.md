# !teb

The **!teb** extension displays a formatted view of the information in the thread environment block (TEB).

```dbgcmd
!teb [TEB-Address] 
```

## \Parameters

<span id="_______TEB-Address______"></span><span id="_______teb-address______"></span><span id="_______TEB-ADDRESS______"></span> *TEB-Address*   
The hexadecimal address of the thread whose TEB you want to examine. (This is not the address of the TEB as derived from the kernel thread block for the thread.) If *TEB-Address* is omitted in user mode, the TEB for the current thread is used. If it is omitted in kernel mode, the TEB corresponding to the current [register context](../debugger/changing-contexts.md#register-context) is displayed.

## DLL

Exts.dll

## Additional Information

For information about thread environment blocks, see *Microsoft Windows Internals* by Mark Russinovich and David Solomon.

## Remarks

The TEB is the user-mode portion of Microsoft Windows thread control structures.

If the **!teb** extension with no argument gives you an error in kernel mode, you should use the [**!process**](-process.md) extension to determine the TEB address for the desired thread. Make sure your [register context](../debugger/changing-contexts.md#register-context) is set to the desired thread, and then use the TEB address as the argument for **!teb**.

Here is an example of this command's output in user mode:

```dbgcmd

.  1  id: 324.48c   Suspend: 1 Teb 7ffdd000 Unfrozen

The similar [**!peb**](-peb.md) extension displays the process environment block.
