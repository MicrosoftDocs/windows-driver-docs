# !running

The **!running** extension displays a list of running threads on all processors of the target computer.

```dbgcmd
!running [-i] [-t]
```

## Parameters

<span id="_______-i______"></span><span id="_______-I______"></span> **-i**   
Causes the display to include idle processors as well.

<span id="_______-t______"></span><span id="_______-T______"></span> **-t**   
Causes a stack trace to be displayed for each processor.

## DLL

Kdexts.dll

## Additional Information

For more information about debugging multiprocessor computers, see [Multiprocessor Syntax](multiprocessor-syntax.md).

## Remarks

With no options, **!running** will display the affinity of all active processors and all idle processors. For all active processors, it will also display the current and next thread fields from the process control block (PRCB) and the state of the 16 built-in queued spin locks.

Here is an example from a multiprocessor Itanium system:

```dbgcmd
0: kd> !running
 
System Processors 3 (affinity mask)
 Idle Processors 0
 
     Prcb              Current           Next
  0  e0000000818f8000  e0000000818f9e50  e0000000866f12f0  ................
 1  e000000086f16010  e00000008620ebe0  e000000086eddbc0  .O..............
```

The 16 characters at the end of each line indicate the built-in queued spin locks (the LockQueue entries in the PRCB). A period ( . ) indicates that the lock is not in use, **O** means the lock is owned by this processor, and **W** means the processor is queued for the lock. To see more information about the spin lock queue, use [**!qlocks**](-qlocks.md).

Here is an example that shows active and idle processors, along with their stack traces:

```dbgcmd
0: kd> !running -it
 
System Processors f (affinity mask)
  Idle Processors f
All processors idle.
