# !ndiskd.pktpools

**Warning**  This extension is for legacy NDIS 5.x drivers. The [NDIS\_PACKET](/previous-versions/windows/hardware/network/ff557086(v=vs.85)) structure and its associated architecture have been deprecated.

The **!ndiskd.pktpools** extension displays a list of all allocated packet pools.

```console
!ndiskd.pktpools
```

### DLL

Ndiskd.dll

### Examples

Run the **!ndiskd.pktpools** extension to see a list of all allocated packet pools on the system. Note that the handles for the packet pools are not clickable, which means you can't explore further information about the packet pool. This is because NDIS does not use packet pools starting with NDIS 6.0, so these pools are allocated only for legacy drivers which may still be on older systems. The debugee machine in this example does not have any legacy NDIS 5.x drivers installed so the packet pools are not used. This example is for illustrative purposes only.

```console
3: kd> !ndiskd.pktpools
