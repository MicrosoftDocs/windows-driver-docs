# !locks (!kdext\*.locks)

The **!locks** extension in Kdextx86.dll and Kdexts.dll displays information about kernel ERESOURCE locks.

This extension command should not be confused with the [**!ntsdexts.locks**](-locks---ntsdexts-locks-.md) extension command.

```dbgcmd
!locks [Options] [Address]
```

## Parameters

*Options*
Specifies the amount of information to be displayed. Any combination of the following options can be used:

<span id="-v"></span><span id="-V"></span>**-v**  
Displays detailed information about each lock.

<span id="-p"></span><span id="-P"></span>**-p**  
Display all available information about the locks, including performance statistics.

<span id="-d"></span><span id="-D"></span>**-d**  
Display information about all locks. Otherwise, only locks with contention are displayed.)

<span id="_______Address______"></span><span id="_______address______"></span><span id="_______ADDRESS______"></span> *Address*   
Specifies the hexadecimal address of the ERESOURCE lock to be displayed. If *Address* is 0 or omitted, information about all ERESOURCE locks in the system will be displayed.

### DLL

Kdexts.dll

 

## Remarks

The **!locks** extension displays all locks held on resources by threads. A lock can be shared or exclusive, which means no other threads can gain access to that resource. This information is useful when a deadlock occurs on a system. A deadlock is caused by one non-executing thread holding an exclusive lock on a resource that the executing thread needs.

You can usually pinpoint a deadlock in Microsoft Windows 2000 by finding one non-executing thread that holds an exclusive lock on a resource that is required by an executing thread. Most of the locks are shared.

Here is an example of the basic **!locks** output:

```dbgcmd
kd> !locks
**** DUMP OF ALL RESOURCE OBJECTS ****
KD: Scanning for held locks......

Resource @ 0x80e97620    Shared 4 owning threads
     Threads: ff688da0-01<*> ff687da0-01<*> ff686da0-01<*> ff685da0-01<*> 
KD: Scanning for held locks.......................................................

Resource @ 0x80e23f38    Shared 1 owning threads
     Threads: 80ed0023-01<*> *** Actual Thread 80ed0020
KD: Scanning for held locks.

Resource @ 0x80d8b0b0    Shared 1 owning threads
     Threads: 80ed0023-01<*> *** Actual Thread 80ed0020
2263 total locks, 3 locks currently held
```

Note that the address for each thread displayed is followed by its thread count (for example, "-01"). If a thread is followed by "&lt;\*&gt;", that thread is one of the owners of the lock. In some instances, the initial thread address contains an offset. In that case, the actual thread address is displayed as well.

If you want to find more information about one of these resource objects, use the address that follows "Resource \@" as an argument for future commands. To investigate the second resource shown in the preceding example, you could use [**dt ERESOURCE 80d8b0b0**](dt--display-type-.md) or [**!thread 80ed0020**](-thread.md). Or you could use the **!locks** extension again with the **-v** option:

```dbgcmd
kd> !locks -v 80d8b0b0

Resource @ 0x80d8b0b0    Shared 1 owning threads
     Threads: 80ed0023-01<*> *** Actual Thread 80ed0020
