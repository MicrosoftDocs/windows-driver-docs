# Using Shell Commands


## <span id="ddk_using_shell_commands_dbg"></span><span id="DDK_USING_SHELL_COMMANDS_DBG"></span>


The debugger can transmit certain commands to the Microsoft Windows environment in which the debugger is running.

You can use the [**.shell (Command Shell)**](-shell--command-shell-.md) command in any Windows debugger. With this command, you can execute an application or a Microsoft MS-DOS command directly from the debugger. If you are performing [remote debugging](../debugger/remote-debugging.md), these shell commands are executed on the server.

The [**.noshell (Prohibit Shell Commands)**](-noshell--prohibit-shell-commands-.md) command or the **-noshell** [command-line option](../debugger/command-line-options.md) disables all shell commands. The commands are disabled while the debugger is running, even if you begin a new debugging session. The commands remain disabled even if you issue a [**.restart (Restart Kernel Connection)**](-restart--restart-kernel-connection-.md) command in KD.

If you are running a debugging server,you might want to disable shell commands. If the shell is available, a remote connection can use the **.shell** command to change your computer.

In WinDbg, you can use the **File | Map Network Drive** and **File | Disconnect Network Drive** commands to control the network drive mappings. These changes always occur on the computer that WinDbg is running on, never on any computer that is remotely connected to WinDbg.
