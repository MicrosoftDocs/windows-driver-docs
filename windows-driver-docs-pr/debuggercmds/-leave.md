# .leave

The **.leave** token is used to exit from a [**.catch**](-catch.md) block.

```dbgcmd
.catch { ... ; .if (Condition) .leave ; ... } 
```

## Additional Information

For information about other control flow tokens and their use in debugger command programs, see [Using Debugger Command Programs](../debugger/using-debugger-command-programs.md).

## Remarks

When a **.leave** token is encountered within a [**.catch**](-catch.md) block, the program exits from the block, and execution resumes with the first command after the closing brace.

Since there is no control flow token equivalent to the C **goto** statement, you will usually use the **.leave** token within an [**.if**](-if.md) conditional, as shown in the syntax examples above. However, this is not actually required.
