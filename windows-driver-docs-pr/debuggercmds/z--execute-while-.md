# z (Execute While)

The **z** command executes a command while a given condition is true.

User-Mode

```dbgcmd
Command ; z( Expression ) 
```

Kernel-Mode

```dbgcmd
Command ; [Processor] z( Expression )
```

## <span id="ddk_cmd_execute_while_dbg"></span><span id="DDK_CMD_EXECUTE_WHILE_DBG"></span>Parameters


<span id="_______Command______"></span><span id="_______command______"></span><span id="_______COMMAND______"></span> *Command*   
Specifies the command to execute while the *Expression* condition evaluates to a nonzero value. This command is always executed at least once.

<span id="_______Processor______"></span><span id="_______processor______"></span><span id="_______PROCESSOR______"></span> *Processor*   
Specifies the processor that applies to the test. For more information about the syntax, see [Multiprocessor Syntax](multiprocessor-syntax.md). You can specify processors only in kernel mode.

<span id="_______Expression______"></span><span id="_______expression______"></span><span id="_______EXPRESSION______"></span> *Expression*   
Specifies the condition to test. If this condition evaluates to a nonzero value, the *Command* command is executed again and then *Expression* is tested again. For more information about the syntax, see [Numerical Expression Syntax](numerical-expression-syntax.md).

## Remarks

In many debugger commands, the semicolon is used to separate unrelated commands. However, in the **z** command, a semicolon separates the "z" from the *Command* parameter.

The *Command* command is always executed at least once, and then *Expression* is tested. If the condition is a nonzero value, the command is again executed, and then *Expression* is tested again. (This behavior is similar to a C-language **do - while** loop, not a simple **while** loop.)

If there are several semicolons to the left of the "z", all commands to the left of the "z" repeat as long as the *Expression* condition is true. Such commands can be any debugger commands that permit a terminal semicolon.

If you add another semicolon and additional commands after the **z** command, these additional commands are executed after the loop is complete. We do not typically recommend a line that begins with "z" because it generates uninteresting output forever unless the condition becomes false because of some other action. Note that you can nest **z** commands.

To break a loop that is continuing for too long, use [**CTRL+C**](../debugger/ctrl-c--break-.md) in CDB or KD, or use **Debug | Break** from the menu, or CTRL+BREAK in WinDbg.

The following code example shows an unnecessarily complex way to zero the **eax** register.

```dbgcmd
0:000> reax = eax - 1 ; z(eax)
```

The following example increments the **eax** and **ebx** registers until one of them is at least 8 and then it increments the **ecx** register once.

```dbgcmd
0:000> reax=eax+1; rebx=ebx+1; z((eax<8)|(ebx<8)); recx=ecx+1
```

The following example uses C++ expression syntax and uses the pseudo-register **$t0** as a loop variable.

```dbgcmd
0:000> .expr /s c++
Current expression evaluator: C++ - C++ source expressions

0:000> db pindexcreate[@$t0].szKey; r$t0=@t0+1; z( @$t0 < cIndexCreate )
```
