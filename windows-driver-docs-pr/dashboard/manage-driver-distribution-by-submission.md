# Manage driver distribution with shipping labels

After you create your hardware submissions and uploaded your driver packages, create shipping labels to distribute your drivers. Shipping labels allow you to:

- Publish your drivers to Windows Update
- Share your drivers with partners
- Publish drivers that are shared with you
- Publish drivers on behalf of your partners
