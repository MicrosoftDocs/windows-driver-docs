# Manage code signing certificates

As a Partner Center administrator, you're responsible for adding, updating, and retiring driver certificates when they expire. This article describes how to get, add, and update code signing certificates to the hardware dashboard.

For more information on rules for driver signing, see [Driver Signing changes in Windows 10, version 1607](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/windows-hardware-certification/driver-signing-changes-in-windows-10-version-1607/ba-p/364894) in the [Windows Hardware Certification blog](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/windows-hardware-certification/bg-p/WindowsHardwareCertification).

## Prerequisites

Register for the Hardware Developer program. If you're not yet registered, follow the steps in [How to register for the Microsoft Windows Hardware Developer Program](hardware-program-register.md).

## Get or renew a code signing certificate

To get a new code signing certificate:

1. Determine which certificate you need. To help you choose a certificate, see [Driver signing requirements](code-signing-reqs.md).

1. If you're re-using a certificate, move on to step 5.

1. Go to the page of one the following certificate authorities and follow their directions for purchase:

    * [Certera Code Signing Certificate](https://certerassl.com/certera-code-signing-certificate)
    * [Certum EV code signing certificate](https://shop.certum.eu/data-safety/code-signing-certificates/certum-ev-code-sigining.html)

1. Once the certificate authority has verified your contact information and your certificate purchase is approved, follow their directions to retrieve the certificate.

1. Select the gear icon in the upper right, then select **Developer settings**, then **Manage Certificates** on the left pane.

1. Select **Add a new certificate**, then select **Next**.

1. Download *Signablefile.bin* and sign it with the new digital certificate for your company using [SignTool](/windows/win32/seccrypto/signtool) with the `/fd sha256` switch and appropriate SHA-2 timestamp.

1. Upload the signed file to Partner Center.
