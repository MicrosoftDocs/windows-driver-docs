## Measure attributes

|Attribute|Value|
|----|----|
|**Audience**|Standard|

|**Measurement criteria**|Machine|
|**Minimum population**|30 devices, using confidence intervals|
|**Passing criteria**|Less than 1%|
|**Measure ID**|32436662|

## Calculation

Using daily distinct devices having winml runtime error divided by daily distinct device count that used winml

Measure value = Daily Distinct DeviceId count that sent Winml Runtime error telemetry / Daily Distinct DeviceId count that sent Winml ProcessInfo telemetry
