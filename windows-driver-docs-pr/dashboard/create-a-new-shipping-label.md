For details about the fields in the request, see [ShippingLabel resource](get-shipping-labels.md#shippinglabel-resource).

#### Points to remember when creating shipping labels

- When publishing to Windows Update (*destination* is **windowsUpdate**), you must include a [publishingSpecifications](get-shipping-labels.md#publishing-specifications-object) object. For automatic installs (*isAutoInstallDuringOSUpgrade* or *isAutoInstallOnApplicableSystems* is true), you must set  *additionalInfoForMsApproval*.
- if in the shipping label *isAutoInstallDuringOSUpgrade* or *isAutoInstallOnApplicableSystems* is true, then *manualAcquisition* must be false and the driver will be published with "May request user input" set to false.
- if in the shipping label *isAutoInstallDuringOSUpgrade* and *isAutoInstallOnApplicableSystems* are false, then *manualAcquisition* must be true and the driver will be published with "May request user input" set to true.
- When sharing with other partners  (*destination* is **anotherPartner**), you must include the [recipientSpecifications](get-shipping-labels.md#recipient-specifications-object) object.

#### Populating targeting information

The **targeting** object contains data that instructs Windows Update about:

- How the driver should be targeted in terms of hardware IDs.

- Whether CHID or restrictions should be applied.

The hardware ID object should contain a valid combination of bundle ID, PNP ID, OS Code, and INF name when creating a new shipping label. Download the driver metadata file (provided as a link when you get details of a submission) to get the allowed, valid combinations of these attributes for your submission. For more info, see [driver package metadata](driver-package-metadata.md).
