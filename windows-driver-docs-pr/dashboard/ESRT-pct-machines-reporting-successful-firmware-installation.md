# Percent of machines reporting successful firmware installation from ESRT

## Description

The measure aggregates telemetry from a 28-day sliding window into a ratio of successful installs over attempts. A successful installation is defined when the following events happen:

1. Firmware with device instance starting with UEFI is installed via drvinst.
2. Machine reboots and firmware is applied.
3. UEFI.sys reports a successful installation upon boot.

If the machine is reports a transient error (listed below) then it is not included in the population.

|Error Code|Value|
|----|----|
|3221225659| STATUS_NOT_SUPPORTED|
|3221226195| STATUS_POWER_STATE_INVALID|
|3221226206| STATUS_INSUFFICIENT_POWER|
|3221225506| STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED|
|3221225473| STATUS_UNSUCCESSFUL|
|3221225517| STATUS_NOT_COMMITTED|
|3221225560| STATUS_UNKNOWN_REVISION|
|3221225626| STATUS_INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES|
|3221226194| STATUS_PNP_REBOOT_REQUIRED|
|3221225659| STATUS_NOT_SUPPORTED|
|3221226195| STATUS_POWER_STATE_INVALID|
|3221226206| STATUS_INSUFFICIENT_POWER|
|3221225862| STATUS_DEVICE_PROTOCOL_ERROR|
|3221226681| STATUS_UNSATISFIED_DEPENDENCIES|
|3221226029| STATUS_RETRY|

STATUS_INVALID_IMAGE_FORMAT is a result of the firmware returning invalid image format in the last attempt status of the [ESRT table](../bringup/esrt-table-definition.md). This code is returned from the firmware, saying that the new firmware itself has an error. Windows can't help because the capsule update process is entirely platform code and is done outside of the operating system.

The firmware team has open-sourced multiple ways to record information about why a firmware process may have failed such that the information can be retrieved on the next boot of the operating system. These are:

LastAttemptStatus:
- This works well if you're already using the FmpDevicePkg to build your firmware-based capsule drivers.
- [Fmp Dxe - Project Mu](https://microsoft.github.io/mu/dyn/mu_tiano_plus/FmpDevicePkg/FmpDxe/ReadMe/)
- [FmpDeviceSetImageWithStatus](https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/blob/5531fd48ded1271b8775725355ab83994e4bc77c/FmpDevicePkg/Include/Library/FmpDeviceLib.h#L578)

Mu WHEA Telemetry:
- This is an add-on to EDK2-based and Mu-based firmware that will handle telemetry reporting in a way that is automatically picked up by the operating system.
- [mu_plus/MsWheaPkg at release/202102 · microsoft/mu_plus · GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/mu_plus/tree/release/202102/MsWheaPkg)

No matter what you choose, there is a cost to instrumenting systems to gather more information. Windows can't help because the capsule update process is entirely platform code and is done outside the operating system.
