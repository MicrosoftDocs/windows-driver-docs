# Submit a Device Metadata Package (Dashboard help)

After you have created a new device metadata package or replaced an existing package, you can submit the package for validation and subsequent publication.

## Submitting a device metadata package

You can use the same method to submit packages for preview or release.

### To submit a device metadata package

1. Sign the metadata package with the [SignTool tool](/windows/win32/seccrypto/signtool).

2. Sign in to the **Dashboard** from either the Hardware Dev Center or the Windows Dev Center by using a Microsoft account.

3. Under **Device metadata**, click either **Create experience** (if you want to submit a new experience), or **Manage experience** (if you want to modify an existing experience).

4. Browse for and select your new experience, and then click **Submit**.

For more information, see [Create a Device Metadata Experience](create-a-device-metadata-experience.md) or [Manage Device Metadata Experiences](manage-device-metadata-experiences.md).

During the submission process, the dashboard validates the packages in your experience.

### Package validation

During validation, the dashboard performs the following actions for each package:

- Confirms the file is code-signed.

- Scans for viruses.

- Checks the package structure.

- Validates all .xml files against the appropriate schema.

- Verifies that all icons are in compliance with the designated Windows operating system.

- Verifies that all relational fields in the .xml files point to existing resources.

- Verifies that all required tasks and status elements are included in the DeviceStage packages.

- Verifies that hardware certification submissions that are bound to a device experience are for the correct device.

- Writes the date value into the package, and confirms the device experience.

- Creates and signs .cat files in each directory to indicate validation.

- Reconstructs the package and renames it as a GUID.

- Signs the device metadata package.

### Submitting a service metadata package
