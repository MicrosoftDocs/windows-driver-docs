# Get product data

Use the following methods in *Microsoft Hardware APIs* to get data for hardware products registered to your Dev Center Account. For an introduction to Microsoft Hardware APIs, including prerequisites for using the API, see [Manage hardware submissions using APIs](dashboard-api.md).

```cpp
https://manage.devcenter.microsoft.com/v2.0/my/hardware/products/
```

Before you can use these methods, the product must already exist in your Dev Center account. To create or manage submissions for products, see the methods in [Manage product submissions](manage-product-submissions.md).

| Method | URI | Description |
|-|-|-|
|GET |`https://manage.devcenter.microsoft.com/v2.0/hardware/products/`|[Get data for all your products](get-all-products.md)|
|GET |`https://manage.devcenter.microsoft.com/v2.0/hardware/products/{productID}`|[Get data for a specific product](get-a-product.md)|
|GET |`https://manage.devcenter.microsoft.com/v2.0/hardware/products/{productID}/submissions`|[Get data for all submissions of a product](get-all-submissions.md)|
|GET |`https://manage.devcenter.microsoft.com/v2.0/hardware/products/{productID}/submissions/{submissionId}`|[Get data for a specific submission of a product](get-a-submission.md)|

## Prerequisites

If you have not done so already, complete all the [prerequisites](dashboard-api.md) for the Microsoft Hardware APIs before trying to use any of these methods.

## Data resources

The Microsoft Hardware APIs methods for getting product data use the following JSON data resources
