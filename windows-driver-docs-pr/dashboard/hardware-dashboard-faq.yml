          One organization can associate multiple certificates with its dashboard account. Your submissions must be signed with any one of those certificates.

      - question: |
          Managing submissions
        answer: |
          ### Submission processing time for hardware certification
          
          All hardware submissions to the dashboard will be processed within five business days or less, depending on whether the submission requires manual review. Manual review may be required if your submission's tests fail, if it does not have a valid filter applied, or due to internal business policy.
          
          ### Potential differences noticed in download signed files
          
          In order to make Windows 10 more secure without affecting performance, all binaries are now receiving embedded signatures. This applies to all submissions for certification, not only Windows 10 submissions.
          
          ### Getting a single cat file if drivers are uniform for all operating systems
          
          Make sure your final package has a single driver folder on the **Package** tab and the driver’s properties include all the operating systems you have tested. For more information, see [Walkthrough: How to get a driver signed by Microsoft for multiple versions of Windows](get-drivers-signed-by-microsoft-for-multiple-windows-versions.md).
          
          ### Adding new marketing names to the approved submission
          
          Check the announcement date that has been set. If the announcement date has passed, you won't be able to add a new name.
          
          ### Sharing a link to a Windows Certification Verification Report
          
          * A sharable URL contains three identification numbers separated by slashes as shown below: `https://developer.microsoft.com/dashboard/hardware/driver/DownloadCertificationReport/SellerID/PrivateProductID/SubmissionID`
          
          * The identification numbers used in the URL, and their locations are as follows:
          
          | Component | Description |
          | ---       | ---         |
          |SellerID   | The identification number of your partner account. This can be found on the account management page, under **Account settings**. |
          |PrivateProductID | The identification number generated with each product creation. Located on the driver details page for your product. See [Dashboard ID definitions](./id-definitions.md) for more information. |
          |SubmissionID | The idenfication number given to each submission and submission update. Located on the driver details page for your product. See [Dashboard ID definitions](./id-definitions.md) for more information. |
          
          * To create a sharable link, replace **SellerID**, **PrivateProductID**, and **SubmissionID** in the example URL above with the appropriate identification numbers.
          * This URL allows the report to be accessed and downloaded without prior authorization or access to the Partner Center.

          Troubleshooting submission upload errors
        answer: |
          ### My driver signing submission fails with the error “There are files at the root of the cabinet” or “\#No .inf files found in driver directory/directories: XYZ”
          
          The failure is caused by an incorrect .cab file structure. The .cab structure was created with driver files in the root folder of the .cab file instead of having them in a subfolder. See [Attestation signing a kernel driver for public release](attestation-signing-a-kernel-driver-for-public-release.md) for instructions on how to create a proper .cab file for your driver signing submission.
          
          ### "It looks like your package is corrupt or missing important information. Ensure you are using the latest version of the kit, regenerate your package, and try again. If you continue to experience the issue, contact Support."
          
          If you continue to experience issues with your package submission, contact Support in the dashboard header.
          
          ### "File is using Zip64(4gb+file Size)"
          
          This error is caused when the uploaded archive's filetype is .zip64 instead of .zip. This is caused by a large filesize. To fix this error, repackage the submission using the below steps.
          
          1. Rename the current .hckx/hlkx file to .zip.
          2. Extract to a folder.
          3. Open the folder.
          4. Select all items, then select and hold (or right-click) and select **Send to Compressed zip folder**.
          5. Rename the new .zip folder as .hckx/.hlkx.
          6. Upload the new .hckx/.hlkx file.
          
          ### The DUA package error shows "Failed to open package" with the error “Not compatible with a version (3.2.0.0) with this instance package manager”
          
          * Use [HLK studio](/windows-hardware/test/hlk/user/install-standalone-hlk-studio) to open the downloaded DUA shell package and to create DUA submission.
