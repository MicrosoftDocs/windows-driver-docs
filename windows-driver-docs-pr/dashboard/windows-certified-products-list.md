# Windows Compatible Products List

The [Windows Compatible Products List](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/hardware/search/cpl) is a comprehensive list of certified devices and systems. The Windows Compatible Products list has the following features and restrictions:

* You can find devices and systems by filtering the list or by running a search for a specific product name.
* You can search across all certified devices and systems for the entire catalog.
* If you need an OEM system report for RFPs, you can search for the product/marketing name and receive a verification report, which you can download. 
* The Compatible Products List displays Declarative & Universal status for all Device Classes.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>System search does not support the D & U status field. Therefore, you must set the **D & U Status** search field dropdown to **All** to see system results.

## Searching for Marketing and Product names for systems or devices

If you search using the **Marketing/Product Name** box, the Compatible Products List returns matches in the product name, submission name, and marketing name fields. Consider these:

* Limit your search to plain text, without quotes or wildcards.
* Any spaces between words are treated as **AND** expressions.
* Do not use any special characters or search-limiting terms. For example, do not use (OR, AND, ””, \*, ?, etc.).

## Searching for a Company Name 

Limit your searches to plain text, without quotes or wildcards. For example, do not use (OR, AND, ””, \*, ?, etc.).

The search function will auto-complete results after you type five letters. 

> [!NOTE]
>You may find that some companies are listed twice. This is a result of merging the previous database with Hardware Dev Center. Each entry is different, so it’s best to search using the **Marketing/Product Name** field.
