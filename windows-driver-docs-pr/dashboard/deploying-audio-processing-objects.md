# Deploying Audio Processing Objects

The Windows audio engine supports third-party user-mode plugins for processing audio.
These are called "[audio processing objects](/windows-hardware/drivers/audio/windows-audio-processing-objects)." The correct .inf class to use for drivers that install audio processing objects is different depending on the version of Windows.

## Deploying to Windows 11 and later

For Windows 11 21H2 build 22000 and later, all audio processing objects must be marked as `Class=AudioProcessingObject`. Shipping labels which deploy audio processing objects to Windows 11 21H2 and later with an incorrect .inf class are subject to rejection.

## Deploying to Windows 10

For Windows 10, all audio processing objects must be marked as `Class=SoftwareComponent`.

* Shipping labels which deploy audio processing objects to Windows 10 with an incorrect .inf class are subject to rejection.

* Users have the option to upgrade their Windows 10 machines to Windows 11. Any shipping label that deploys an audio processing object to Windows 10 machines must have an [OS ceiling](/windows-hardware/drivers/dashboard/limit-driver-distribution) to prevent the driver from being deployed to Windows 11 machines. Partners must also publish a second corresponding shipping label, with an [OS floor](/windows-hardware/drivers/dashboard/limit-driver-distribution) of Windows 11 21H2, which deploys a `Class=AudioProcessingObject` driver package to the same HWIDs and CHIDs.

## What to do if your shipping label is rejected

If your shipping label was rejected for one of the above reasons, please contact the Windows audio team at audio-partners@microsoft.com.
