# Get shipping label data

For an introduction to Microsoft Hardware APIs, including prerequisites for using the API, see [Manage hardware submissions using APIs](dashboard-api.md).

Use the following methods in *Microsoft Hardware APIs* to get data for shipping labels of hardware products registered to your Hardware Dev Center Account.

```html
https://manage.devcenter.microsoft.com/v2.0/my/hardware/products/{productId}/submissions/{submissionId}/shippingLabels/
```

Before you can use these methods, the product and submission must already exist in your Dev Center account. To create or manage submissions for products, see the methods in [Manage product submissions](manage-product-submissions.md).

|Description|Method|URI|
|-|-|-|
|[Get data for all shipping labels of a submission](get-all-shipping-labels.md)|GET|`https://manage.devcenter.microsoft.com/v2.0/my/hardware/products/{productId}/submissions/{submissionId}/shippingLabels/`|
|[Get data for a specific shipping label of a submission](get-a-shipping-label.md)|GET|`https://manage.devcenter.microsoft.com/v2.0/my/hardware/products/{productId}/submissions/{submissionId}/shippingLabels/{shippingLabelId}`|

## Prerequisites

If you have not done so already, complete all the [Prerequisites](./dashboard-api.md#complete-the-prerequisites-for-using-the-microsoft-hardware-api) for the Microsoft Hardware APIs before trying to use any of these methods.

## Data resources

The Microsoft hardware dashboard API methods for getting shipping label  data use the following JSON data resources.
