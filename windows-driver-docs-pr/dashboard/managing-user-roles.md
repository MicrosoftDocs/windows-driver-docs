# Managing User Roles

You can use the Partner Center to assign specific roles to each of your users. The following roles are available for dashboard users:

| Role                           | Description             |
|--------------------------------|--------------|
| Administrator     | Has complete control of your organization. Can manage roles in Dev Center and can complete any task.    |
| Upgrade Test Results Submitter | Can submit upgrade test results for your organization.    |
| Legal Agreement Signer         | Can renew and sign legal agreements on behalf of your organization.    |
| Report Reviewer                | Can access analytics about your drivers and systems. Able to see failure details and download cabs.   |
| Driver Submitter   | Can create new driver submissions, but can’t create shipping labels.   |
| Shipping Label Owner  | Can create and manage shipping labels, and can submit shipping labels including shipping labels with driver promotions (automatic installation) selected.   |
