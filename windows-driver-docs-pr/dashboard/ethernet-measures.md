# Ethernet measures

## Description

Microsoft provides LAN device manufactures with the Network Driver Interface Specification (NDIS) and NetAdapter WDF class extension. A NDIS/WDF compliant driver enables manufactures to develop a universal driver
that is functional on device platforms, improves the quality of a LAN driver, and reduces the complexity of the driver package. A machine can use a NDIS/NetAdapter compliant driver so its network component
and Windows OS can communicate and enable networking connection for the end user. For more info about NDIS driver development, see [Roadmap for Developing NDIS Drivers](../network/roadmap-for-developing-ndis-drivers.md), for WDF NetAdapter driver development, see [Building a NetAdapterCx client driver](../netcx/building-a-netadaptercx-client-driver.md).

Ethernet measures provide insights into the performance and reliability of wired network connections across Windows devices. These metrics help ensure users experience fast and stable Internet connectivity when using physical Ethernet adapters.
