# Appeal a rejected audio driver

If your audio driver was rejected you can appeal the rejection as follows:

1. Open a bug on <a href="/collaborate/">Collaborate</a>
1. Add the keyword "AudioDriverAppeal" to the title of the bug
1. In the body of the bug, include the following
    * The rejected shipping labels that you want to appeal
    * The reason the shipping labels were rejected, as you understand it
    * The reason you want to deploy the shipping label anyway
    * The plan to avoid future rejections
1. Send an email to audio-partners@microsoft.com with the bug number
