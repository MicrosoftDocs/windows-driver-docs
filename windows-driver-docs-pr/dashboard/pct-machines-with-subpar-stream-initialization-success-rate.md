# Percent of Machines with Subpar Stream Initialization Success Rate

## Description

See the "Audio stream initialization" section at [Audio measures](audio-measures.md)

These measures determine an *audio stream initialization success rate* for each machine and calculates a percentage of machines with less than 90% stream initialization rate. When an application is unable to initialize an audio stream, the user will not have access to the applicationâ€™s audio experience.

Some machines have multiple audio drivers on them. Some audio drivers work together to power the same audio hardware; some audio drivers work separately to power different audio hardware on the same machine.

Measure 11458866 looks at the audio stream initialization success rate for *all* audio hardware on the machine where the driver flight landed.

## Measure attributes

|Attribute|Value|
|----|----|
|**Audience**|Audio measures capture data from any machine that is playing audio on Windows|
|**Time period**|7 day sliding window|
|**Measurement criteria**|Aggregation of machines|
|**Minimum population**|1000 machines|
|**Passing criteria**|<=0.5% of machines with an initialization success rate below 90%|
|**Measure IDs**|11458866|

## Calculation

1.	The measure aggregates telemetry from a 7-day sliding window into a percentage of machines that have a subpar initialization rate.
2.	For each machine, calculate the:
    a.	Machine initialization success rate = count (Failed Initializations) / count (total attempted initializations)
    b.	Failing machine = machines initialization success rate < 90%
3.	Machines  with subpar initialization = count (failing machines)
4.	Total machines = count (all machines that attempted initialization)

### Final calculation

*Percent of machines with subpar initialization rates = Machines with subpar initialization / Total machines*
