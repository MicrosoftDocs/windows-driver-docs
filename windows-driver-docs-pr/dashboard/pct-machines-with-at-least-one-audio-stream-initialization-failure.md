# Percent of machines with at least one audio stream initialization failure

## Description

See the "Audio stream initialization" section at [Audio measures](audio-measures.md)

## Measure attributes

|Attribute|Value|
|----|----|
|**Audience**|Audio measures capture data from any machine that is playing audio on Windows|
|**Time period**|7 day sliding window|
|**Measurement criteria**|Aggregation of machines|
|**Minimum population**|1000 machines|
|**Passing criteria**|<=2 % of machines with at least one audio steam initialization failure|
|**Measure ID**| 39415055 |

## Calculation

1. The measure aggregates telemetry from a 7-day sliding window into a **percentage of machines that have at least one unexpected initialization failure**
2. *Machines with initialization failure = Count(machines with at least one unexpected initialization failure)*
3. *Total machines = Count(machines that attempted to initialize an audio stream)*

### Final calculation

*Percent of machines with at least one stream initialization failure = Machines with initialization failure / Total machines*
