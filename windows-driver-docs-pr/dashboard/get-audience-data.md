# Get audience data

Use the following method in *Microsoft Hardware APIs* to get the audiences applicable to your organization. Audiences allow you to restrict a publication to machines with a particular configuration. As an example, a test deployment can be delivered only to clients with a particular registry key installed.

```cpp
https://manage.devcenter.microsoft.com/v2.0/my/hardware/audiences
```

Before you can use these methods, the product and submission must already exist in your Dev Center account. To create or manage submissions for products, see the methods in [Manage product submissions](manage-product-submissions.md).
