# Windows Device Experience List

The Windows Device Experience List is a comprehensive list of devices that have supporting Windows 7 device experiences submitted through the dashboard. Most external devices and PCs are eligible to have a device experience. Devices and Printers folder devices and Device Stage devices have specific rules on submissions to the dashboard and the Windows Certification Program.

The Windows Device Experience List is compatible with Internet Explorer 6 and above.

## Searching for a device in the Windows Device Experience List

To search for a device in the Windows Device Experience List (in this example, a laptop), follow these steps:

1. On the **Device Class** menu on the left, click **Personal Computer** and then click **Computer.Laptop**. A list of all of the laptops in the Device Experience List appears.

2. You can filter this result set and narrow your selection by **Company**, **Locale**, **Category**, and **Device Stage**.

3. You can sort individual columns by clicking on the appropriate header at the top of the list.

A green checkmark in the **Device Stage** column indicates a Device Stage experience. No checkmark indicates a Devices and Printers experience.

### To filter your results

You can filter any set of results with the drop-down menus at the top of the list.

1. Select any combination of **Company**, **Locale**, **Category**, or **Device Stage** from the filter drop-downs at the top of any set of results.

   >[!NOTE]
   >Selecting **Yes** on the **Device Stage** filter limits models to those with a Device Stage experience.

2. Click **Go** to apply the filter.

To re-expand a filter, select **All** in the filter and then click **Go**.

## To sort your results

You can sort any set of results by **Model Name**, **Company**, **Locale**, **Category**, or **Device Stage**.

- Click any header to sort the results by that attribute in ascending order.

- Click the header again to sort the results by that attribute in descending order.
