# Get started with the hardware dashboard program

The Partner Center enables you to create and manage your system and driver submissions quickly and easily, with improved experiences for:

* Using the dashboard API to programmatically work with submissions

* HCK/HLK device certification submissions

* Publishing to Windows Update as either a critical and/or dynamic update using shipping labels

* Sharing your driver with another company (Resell)

* Customizing your driver after initial certification (DUA)

* Managing your users and legal agreements

* System/Hardware certification submissions

To access the hardware dashboard, you need to register for hardware program.

## Register for the hardware program

Your company's administrator must [register](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=828002) for the Windows Hardware Dev Center program. See [Register for the Hardware Program](register-for-the-hardware-program.md) for additional information about the registration process.

## Design, create, and test your hardware and drivers

You can help your customers identify quality products that run reliably on Windows-based computers by testing your products and participating in the Windows Hardware Compatibility Program (for Windows 10), or the Windows Hardware Certification Program (for Windows 8/8.1 and older operating systems).

These programs enable you to design, create, and test your hardware and drivers before you submit the final version through the PArtner Center . For more information, see the [Windows hardware certification](/previous-versions/windows/hardware/hck/jj124227(v=vs.85)) page.

## Submit your hardware and drivers for the compatibility program or certification

* First, take a look at [Hardware certification submissions](hardware-certification-submissions.md). This section explains how to [create a new hardware submission](create-a-new-hardware-submission.md) and [manage hardware submissions](manage-your-hardware-submissions.md).

* For information about attestation signing your drivers on the Sysdev dashboard, see [Attestation signing a kernel driver for public release](attestation-signing-a-kernel-driver-for-public-release.md).

* After your product passes the review, it becomes eligible for the hardware compatibility or certification program. In addition, you can publish it to the [Windows Server Catalog](https://www.windowsservercatalog.com/ ) and the [Windows Certified Products List](windows-certified-products-list.md) by providing an announcement date in your submission.

* If you have drivers that you want to distribute with Windows Update or share with another company, see the [Manage driver distribution with shipping labels](manage-driver-distribution-by-submission.md) section. This section covers common driver distribution tasks such as:

  * [Publish a driver to Windows Update](publish-a-driver-to-windows-update.md)
  * [Share a driver with a partner](sharing-drivers-with-your-partners.md)
  * [Expire a driver from Windows Update](expire-a-driver-from-windows-update.md)
  * [View partner shipping labels for a shared driver](viewing-shipping-labels-for-your-shared-driver.md)
