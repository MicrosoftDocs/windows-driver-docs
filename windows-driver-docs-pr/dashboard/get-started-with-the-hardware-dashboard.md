# Get started with the hardware dashboard program

The Windows Hardware Dev Center Dashboard enables you to create and manage your system and driver submissions quickly and easily, with improved experiences for:

* Using the dashboard API to programmatically work with submissions 

* HCK/HLK device certification submissions

* Publishing to Windows Update as either a critical and/or dynamic update using shipping labels

* Sharing your driver with another company (Resell)

* Customizing your driver after initial certification (DUA)

* Managing your users and legal agreements

* System/Hardware certification submissions

To access the hardware dashboard, you need to register for hardware program.

## Register for the hardware program


Your company's administrator must [register](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=828002) for the Windows Hardware Dev Center program. See [Register for the Hardware Program](register-for-the-hardware-program.md) for additional information about the registration process.

You can help your customers identify quality products that run reliably on Windows-based computers by testing your products and participating in the Windows Hardware Compatibility Program (for Windows 10), or the Windows Hardware Certification Program (for Windows 8/8.1 and older operating systems).

These programs enable you to design, create, and test your hardware and drivers before you submit the final version through the Windows Hardware Dev Center dashboard. For more information, see the [Windows hardware certification](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=224782) page.

-   First, take a look at [Hardware certification submissions](hardware-certification-submissions.md). This section explains how to [create a new hardware submission](create-a-new-hardware-submission.md) and [manage hardware submissions](manage-your-hardware-submissions.md).

-   For information about attestation signing your drivers on the Sysdev dashboard, see [Attestation signing a kernel driver for public release](attestation-signing-a-kernel-driver-for-public-release.md).

-   After your product passes the review, it becomes eligible for the hardware compatibility or certification program. In addition, you can publish it to the [Windows Server Catalog](https://www.windowsservercatalog.com/ ) and the [Windows Certified Products List](windows-certified-products-list.md) by providing an announcement date in your submission.

-   If you have drivers that you want to distribute with Windows Update or share with another company, see the [Manage driver distribution with shipping labels](manage-driver-distribution-by-submission.md) section. This section covers common driver distribution tasks such as:

    -   [Publish a driver to Windows Update](publish-a-driver-to-windows-update.md)
    -   [Share a driver with a partner](sharing-drivers-with-your-partners.md)
    -   [Expire a driver from Windows Update](expire-a-driver-from-windows-update.md)
    -   [View partner shipping labels for a shared driver](viewing-shipping-labels-for-your-shared-driver.md)
