# Cohort Failure Report

Beginning June 15, 2020, Driver Servicing began [evaluating driver quality by targeting cohorts](./overview-of-microsoft-driver-measure-dictionary.md#evaluating-by-targeting-cohort). To improve on this process, starting October 30, 2020, if your driver is cancelled due to a cohort failure you will start to receive a new report detailing the specifics of the [failure](./overview-of-microsoft-driver-measure-dictionary.md#evaluating-by-targeting-cohort).

## Location of the Report

When a driver completes flighting, a bug is created and assigned to you, which includes the Decision Snapshot (a report of the state of the measures at the time of flight completion) [report.html in image below]. We will be utilizing that same bug to include the new Cohort Failure Report if the driver is cancelled due to a cohort failure during release monitoring. It will be added to the RejectedDriverFlightReport Zip file as an attachment to that bug. Inside the Zip file, the file name will be Cohort_Failure_Report.pdf.

## How to Read the Report

This report has 3 sections, **Title**, **Summary**, and **Details**, described below.

### Title Section: describes the driver

This section includes the submitter company name, the date the report is generated, the shipping label number, the driver name, and the driver version.

### Details Section: provides details about the failures that were found

This section includes details about the failures that were found. The section will repeat for each failing cohort that is found. 

The section first lists a targeting cohort (Hardware ID, CHID, and OS version) where the failure was found. This is followed by the list of measures that failed for that targeting cohort, including:

- The Measure ID (to look it up in the Measure Dictionary and the Flight Report).
- The Measure name
- The result of the measure at the time of the report
- The passing criteria
- The status of the measure
- The number of machines in that cohort that have adopted the driver and were used to calculate the measure.
