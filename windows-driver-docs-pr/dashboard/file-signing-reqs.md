# LSA plugin or UEFI firmware signing requirements

You can use the Partner Center hardware dashboard to digitally sign [Local Security Authority (LSA)](/windows-server/security/credentials-protection-and-management/configuring-additional-lsa-protection) plugins and [UEFI firmware](/windows-hardware/design/device-experiences/oem-uefi) binaries, to enable them to be installed on windows devices.

## LSA plugins and UEFI firmware

- LSA plugins and UEFI firmware signing requires an [extended validation (EV) code signing certificate](code-signing-reqs.md#ev-certificate-signed-drivers).
- All LSA and UEFI submissions must be a single, signed CAB library file, and contain all files required for signing.
- This file should contain no folders and only the binaries or .efi files to be signed.
- **UEFI FIRMWARE ONLY** - The CAB file signature must match the [Authenticode certificate](../install/authenticode.md) for your organization.
- Depending on your certificate provider, you may need to use [SignTool](/windows/desktop/SecCrypto/signtool) or an external process.
- EFI ByteCode (EBC) files must be compiled using the /ALIGN:32 flag for processing to succeed.
- **UEFI FIRMWARE ONLY** - If your submission is a shim, you must submit a completed template for review to the shim review board. The shim review process is described at [https://github.com/rhboot/shim-review/](https://github.com/rhboot/shim-review/).
- **LSA PLUGINS ONLY** - The CAB file signature must match the EV code signing certificate for your organization.
