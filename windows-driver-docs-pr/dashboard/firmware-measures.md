# Firmware Measures

Windows supports a platform for installing machines and device firmware updates through driver packages that are processed by using the UEFI Update Capsule function, as noted in the [Windows UEFI firmware update platform](../bringup/windows-uefi-firmware-update-platform.md). The UEFI platform supports both machine and device-level firmware updates, enabling external partners to safely update their customers’ machines. An erring firmware package can seriously harm the user’s machine and cause the machine to longer function whatsoever.
