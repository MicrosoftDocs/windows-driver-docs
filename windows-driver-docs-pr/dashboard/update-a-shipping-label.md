For details about the fields in the request, see [ShippingLabel resource](get-shipping-labels.md#shippinglabel-resource).

Points to note:

* You must provide a value for *action* when updating CHIDs or HardwareIDs.

* *Audience* is an update-only field. Providing a value in this field overwrites any previous value. Leaving the value blank removes the previous value.

* To learn how to get a list of audiences for your organization, see [get audience](get-audience-data.md).

* The hardware ID object should contain a valid combination of bundle ID, PNP ID, OS Code, and INF name when updating a shipping label. To get the valid, allowed combinations of these attributes for your submission (package), download the driver metadata file (provided as a link) when you get the details of a submission. For details, see [Driver package metadata](driver-package-metadata.md).
