# Establish a relationship for HWID and CHID targeting

Establishing a relationship for computer hardware ID (CHID) or hardware ID (HWID) targeting is a prerequisite for all HWID or CHID targeted driver submissions. Submissions for which an established relationship cannot be validated between the publisher and the owner of the targeted HWIDs or CHIDs will be rejected. Microsoft requires the requests for establishing these relationships to come from the owner of the HWIDs and CHIDs to be targeted.

  > [!NOTE]
    > If you are a publisher whose submission has already been rejected, review the rejection notice on your shipping label page for the HWIDs and CHIDs that need attention. The company (OWNER) for each of the HWIDs or CHIDs will be listed here and you can reach out to them to request that they set up the relationship that will allow you to target their HWIDs and CHIDs. Once approval email from the owner company is received and processed by Microsoft you will be able to create a new submission targeting these HWIDs and CHIDs.

## Steps to establish a relationship

The owner of the HWIDs or CHIDs should send an email to Microsoft requesting the relationship in the following format, listing the specific HWIDs and CHIDs the publishing company is approved to target. The completed email should be sent to HWID-CHID_Validation@microsoft.com.

    Dear Microsoft,
    Please allow *Publishing Company Name* permission to target our *Owner Company Name* HWIDs and CHIDs listed below:

    - HWID and CHID owner company name and seller ID:
    - Name of the publishing company with which the relationship is being established:
    - Seller ID of the publishing company with which the relationship is being established:
    - CHIDs approved for targeting:
    - HWIDs approved for targeting:

## Processing timeline

Typical turnaround time is one to two Microsoft Redmond (PST) business days after the email requesting the relationship is received by Microsoft. Email confirmation will be sent from Microsoft to the owning company once complete.
