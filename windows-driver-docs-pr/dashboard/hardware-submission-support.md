# Get support for Partner Center dashboard issues

## Documentation issues

Most issues can be resolved through the [Partner Center for Windows Hardware documentation](index.yml) or [Hardware Dev Center - Microsoft Tech Community](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/hardware-dev-center/bg-p/HardwareDevCenter). However, if the current documentation doesn't cover your issue, you can submit a support request through GitHub.  When you submit a request in GitHub, you'll be directly connecting with the Partner Center drivers team.

To submit a request to the Partner Center drivers team in GitHub:

1. Go to the Partner Center documentation web page that you believe should've been able to help you with your issue.

    >[!TIP]
    >If the content you are looking for doesn't exist at all, just find a page that is relatively related to your issue.

1. Once you're on the page, select the feedback icon on the upper right side of the page.

1. Enter the title and content of your feedback.

1. Select **Submit new issue**.

1. You should receive a response from the team within 24-48 business hours.

## Technical support issues

If your issue is technical and you can't find answers in the documentation, you can contact Windows developer support.

There are two types of support issues in Windows developer support: Dashboard issues and HLK issues

**To contact Windows developer support for a dashboard issue:**

1. Go to [Windows developer support](https://developer.microsoft.com/windows/support/?tabs=Contact-us).

1. In the *Non-Technical Support-Dashboard* section, select **Submit an incident**.

    :::image type="content" source="images/hardware-submission-support/dashboard-submit-incident.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Submit an incident link for dashboard support.":::

1. Fill in all the required information.

1. Select **Submit**.

**To contact Windows developer support for an HLK issue:**

Before contacting Windows developer support, see if you can find a solution to your issue in [Troubleshooting Windows HLK](/windows-hardware/test/hlk/user/troubleshooting-windows-hlk). If you still can't find a solution to your issue, then contact [Windows HLK support](/windows-hardware/test/hlk/user/windows-hlk-support).
