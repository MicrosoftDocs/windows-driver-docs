# GDL Template Data Types


*GDL template data types* can be classified as [primitive](gdl-primitive-data-types.md) data types and [compound](gdl-compound-data-types.md) data types.

After a data type has been assigned to an attribute template, the parser filter will attempt to parse the value that appears in any GDL entry that is an instance of this template by using the syntax rules that are defined for that data type. You can define some of the syntax by [template directives](gdl-template-directives.md). If the parsing is successful, that data type will map to one or more XML primitive types, which are then emitted in the snapshot as child elements of the attribute.

Templates have special rules for [inheritance](data-type-template-inheritance.md).
