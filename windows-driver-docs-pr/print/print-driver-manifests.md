# Print Driver Manifests

[!include[Print Support Apps](../includes/print-support-apps.md)]

A print driver package may contain two kinds of manifest:

- **Application manifests** are required for all Windows Vista drivers as a security feature. For more information on application manifests, see Guidelines for Writing Device Installation Applications.

- **Theme manifests** are an option for print drivers for controlling the appearance of the print application UI.

For more information on theme manifests, see [Using Theme Manifests](using-theme-manifests.md).
