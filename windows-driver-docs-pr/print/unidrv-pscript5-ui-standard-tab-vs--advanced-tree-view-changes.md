# Unidrv/PScript5 UI Standard Tab vs. Advanced Tree View Changes

[!include[Print Support Apps](../includes/print-support-apps.md)]

The following public Print Schema features are supported by the UniDrive/PScript5 user interface (UI):

JobPageOrder

PageOrientation (PS only)

PageDeviceFontSubstitution

PageOutputQuality

JobNUpAllDocumentsContiguously or DocumentNUp

If there are custom GPD or PPD features or options that are mapped to the preceding Print Schema features and their standard Print Schema options by using GPD's **PrintSchemaKeywordMap** keyword or PPD's **MSPrintSchemaKeywordMap** keyword, the Unidrv/PScript5 driver UI shows the features in the standard tabs in the same way that they appear for Unidrv or PScript5 drivers that are running in non-XPSDrv mode, unless the feature in the GPD file has "\*ConcealFromUI?" set to "TRUE".

When these Print Schema features (which are mapped from GPD or PPD custom features) are shown in Unidrv/Pscript5 driver UI standard tabs rather than in the generic "Printer Features" group in the **Advanced** tree view UI, the standard display names and icons for COMPSTUI are displayed. Any display name or icon that is specified in the GPD or PPD files for these features are ignored.

To present a consistent Unidrv/PScript5 driver UI for these standard printing features, the Unidrv/PScript5 driver that is running in XPSDrv mode has the following behavior.

For any other custom GPD or PPD features, no matter if they are mapped to public Print Schema features or not, they will always be shown in the generic "Printer Features" group in the **Advanced tree view** UI.
