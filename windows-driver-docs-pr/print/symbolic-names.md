# Symbolic Names

[!include[Print Support Apps](../includes/print-support-apps.md)]

A symbolic name is a character string used as an identifier. Symbolic names have the following characteristics:

- The first character must be an uppercase or lowercase letter.

- After the first character, the name can consist of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and the underscore character ( _ ).

- Names are case sensitive.

- The number of characters in a name is unlimited.

The GPD language pre-defines a large number of symbolic names. Predefined names exist for [printer attributes](printer-attributes.md), [command names](command-names.md), [standard features](standard-features.md), [standard options](standard-options.md), and [standard variables](standard-variables.md).

You can define symbolic names for [customized features](customized-features.md), [customized options](customized-options.md), and [macros](macros.md).
