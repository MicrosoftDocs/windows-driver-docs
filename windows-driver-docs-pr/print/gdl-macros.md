# GDL Macros


GDL supports two types of macros: block macros and value macros. The GDL parser evaluates both types of macros by replacing their reference by the contents that are specified in the macro definition. Macro arguments are also supported.

This section includes:

[GDL Value Macros](gdl-value-macros.md)

[GDL Block Macros](gdl-block-macros.md)

[GDL Macro Arguments](gdl-macro-arguments.md)

[GDL Macro Considerations](gdl-macro-considerations.md)

[GDL Miscellaneous Macros](gdl-miscellaneous-macros.md)
