# Print Ticket and Print Capabilities Technologies


Microsoft Windows Vista introduces the Print Capabilities and Print Ticket technologies. These new technologies provide more flexible and extensible print configuration and more consistent printed document appearance than previous methods. These technologies can be used by both Microsoft Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) and Microsoft Win32 applications and XPSDrv print drivers and print drivers that are based on the graphics device interface (GDI).

This section provides the following topics that describe the different components of the Print Ticket and Print Capabilities technologies:
