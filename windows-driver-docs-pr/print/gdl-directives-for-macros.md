# GDL Directives for Macros


GDL has directives that define macros. References to macros are expanded in-line to obtain the entry that is interpreted by the parser.

GDL contains the following macro directives:

-   **\*Macros** defines a group of value macros.

-   **\*BlockMacro** defines a block macro.

-   **\*InsertBlock** references a block macro

-   **=** (equal sign) references a value sign when it is followed by the name of a value macro.

For more information about macro directives, see [GDL Macros](gdl-macros.md).
