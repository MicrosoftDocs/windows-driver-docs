# Installing Driver-Specific Files





Files are associated with a printer driver by including them in the printer's INF file. For more information, see [Printer INF Files](printer-inf-files.md).

To provide Point and Print support for Windows 95/98/98 clients connected to Windows 2000 and later servers, see the description of the "Previous Names" data section in [Printer INF File Data Sections](printer-inf-file-data-sections.md).
