# Best Practices for Client-Side Rendering


You should keep the following items in mind when writing your printer drivers so that they work properly with client-side rendering:

-   Printer drivers should be installed as driver packages.

-   Printer drivers should use the SetPrinterData or SetPrinterDataEx function to store printer configuration information. For more information about these functions, see the Microsoft Windows SDK documentation.

-   Printer drivers that use a custom print processor must include the processor in the driver package and make sure that Point and Print loads it onto the client computer.
