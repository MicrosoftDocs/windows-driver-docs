# Print Ticket Support in Unidrv and PScript5 Print Drivers


In Windows Vista, Print Ticket support has been added to the minidrivers for the Unidrv and PScript5 print drivers. You can add, configure, or remove some features in the GPD file for Unidrv print drivers or the PPD file for PScript5 print drivers. You can also add print driver plug-ins to support custom features that are not provided in the default minidriver. Additionally, you can add print driver plug-ins that remove or disable features that are defined by default but that the printer is unable to perform.
