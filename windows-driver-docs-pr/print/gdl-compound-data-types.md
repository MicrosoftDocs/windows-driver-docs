# GDL Compound Data Types


GDL compound data types are defined from [GDL primitive data types](gdl-primitive-data-types.md) or previously defined compound data types. Compound types can be classified into arrays, composites, and multiple personality types. Compound types can incorporate other compound types that cause the creation of highly-complex data types.

The following compound data types are used for GDL templates:

[Array](array-template-data-types.md)

[Composite](composite-template-data-types.md)

[Multiple Personality](multiple-personality-template-data-types.md)

For more information about issues that relate to compound data types, see [GDL Template Data Type Issues](compound-template-data-type-issues.md).
