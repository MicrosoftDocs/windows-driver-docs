# Defining the Configuration-Dependent Data Parameters


Parameters are introduced by using the **\*Features** construct. The construct tag of the **\*Features** construct identifies the parameter (or defines the parameter name, which is also referred to as the *feature name*).

The content of the **\*Features** construct can consist of one or more **\*Option** constructs. The **\*Option** constructs define the allowed values or states that the parameter can be in. The construct tag of the **\*Option** construct identifies an allowed value or state. This construct tag is also called the *option name*.

For example,you can define a parameter named *Today* that can take a day of the week as its value, as the following code example shows.:

```cpp
*Feature: Today
{
  *Option: Sunday{}
  *Option: Monday{}
  *Option: Tuesday{}
  *Option: Wednesday{}
  *Option: Thursday{}
  *Option: Friday{}
  *Option: Saturday{}
}
```

In the preceding example, the *Today* parameter can take only one value at any given time. *Today* cannot be both **Sunday** and **Tuesday**. However, not all parameters are not limited to exclusive values; they can take one or more values at a time. For example, if you have a robot that can hold more than one color of pen in its hand at the same time, you can define a *PenColors* parameter to describe the colors that are currently in its hand. You might specify **PenColors: (Red AND Green AND Yellow)** and that might be perfectly valid.

The **\*UIType** reserved directive enables you to designate whether a parameter can take only a single value at any time (PICKONE) or whether multiple values can be assigned to that parameter at a given time (PICKMANY). The **\*UIType** directive is positioned as a child entry of the **\*Features** construct.

**Note**   GDL does not allow "nothing" to be assigned to a parameter. Thus, to describe the robot holding no pens, you must declare an option called None or Off for PICKMANY parameters. The option name that is used is not important; you can designate which option is assigned this property by using the **\*NoneOption** directive. The option that **\*NoneOption** designates is not compatible with any of the other options.

 

You can define as many **\*Feature** constructs as you have parameters. All **\*Feature** constructs must reside at the *root context*. The root context has no parent construct.
