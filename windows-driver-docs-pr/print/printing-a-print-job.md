# Print a print job

After a port has been opened, as described in [Opening and closing a port](opening-and-closing-a-port.md), the spooler can send print jobs to the port.

Each print job is delimited by spooler calls to a language or port monitor's [**StartDocPort**](/previous-versions/ff562710(v=vs.85)) and [**EndDocPort**](/previous-versions/ff548742(v=vs.85)) functions. The spooler calls these functions when a print processor calls the spooler's [**StartDocPrinter**](/windows/win32/printdocs/startdocprinter) and [**EndDocPrinter**](/windows/win32/printdocs/enddocprinter) functions.

Within the scope of a set of **StartDocPort** and **EndDocPort** functions, unlimited spooler calls to a monitor's [**WritePort**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/winsplp/nf-winsplp-writeport), [**ReadPort**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/winsplp/nf-winsplp-readport), and [**GetPrinterDataFromPort**](/previous-versions/ff550506(v=vs.85)) functions can occur.

Each of these functions requires the port handle returned by [**OpenPortEx**](/previous-versions/ff559596(v=vs.85)) (or [**OpenPort**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/winsplp/nf-winsplp-openport)) to be specified as in input argument. Typically, a language monitor implements each of the functions by calling the like-named function in its associated port monitor.

When the spooler calls a language monitor's **WritePort** function to send a data stream to the port, the function generally adds language-specific information, such as *PJL* commands, to the received data stream before passing it to the associated port monitor's **WritePort** function.

The **ReadPort** function is used for obtaining status information from bidirectional printer hardware, which a language monitor might send to the spooler by calling [**SetPort**](/windows/win32/printdocs/setport). The spooler does not call the **ReadPort** function.

If printing hardware is bidirectional, both its language monitor and its port monitor should support a **GetPrinterDataFromPort** function. A language monitor's **GetPrinterDataFromPort** function should accept a registry value name as input, obtain a value for that name (generally by calling associated port monitor's **WritePort** and **ReadPort** functions), and return the value to the caller. A port monitor's **GetPrinterDataFromPort** function should accept an I/O control code as input, call [**DeviceIoControl**](/windows/win32/api/ioapiset/nf-ioapiset-deviceiocontrol) to pass the control code to the port driver, and return the result.
