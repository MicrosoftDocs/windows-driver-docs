# \#SetPPPrefix Preprocessor Directive


```GDL
#SetPPPrefix: prefix
```

The \#SetPPPrefix directive makes the *prefix* value the current preprocessor prefix. *prefix* can be any token value and is required.

You can define the same prefix more than once. The prefix is user-selectable because it allows directives to be unambiguously distinguished from any existing not-to-be-processed data. The following code example shows how to change a prefix if a normal GDL entry contains a value that might be confused with an actual directive.

```GDL
*%  assume current prefix is #
#SetPPPrefix: #Temp#
#Temp#Ifdef:  WINNT_60
*InfoMessage: "Use the Preprocessor Directive
#PreCompiled to make your GDL file sharable."
#Temp#Endif:  WINNT_60
#Temp#UndefinePrefix
*%  now back to normal # prefix.
```
