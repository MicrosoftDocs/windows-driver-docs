# Adding GDL Extensions to an Existing PPD File


If you intend to add support for autoconfiguration to an existing in-box PPD file, follow these steps:

1.  Create the GDL file. The GDL file should have the \***BidiQuery** and \***BidiResponse** elements that correspond to the \***Feature**/\***Option** constructs as specified in the PPD file. Note that you must do this only for features that require bidi information.

2.  Include the GDL file as part of driver-dependent file list.
