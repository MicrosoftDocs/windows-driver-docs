# Package-Aware Print Drivers that Share Files


When more than one print driver package shares driver files, the shared files must be isolated into a core driver. For example, Unidrv is a collection of files that many print drivers use, so Unidrv is a core driver.

Unidrv print drivers use the Needs and Include INF-file directives, as shown in the following section of an INF file for Windows XP:

```cpp
[UniDrvInstall]
CopyFiles=@OEMRES.DLL,@OEMABC.GPD
DataFile=OEMABC.GPD
DataSection=UNIDRV_DATA
Include=NTPRINT.INF
Needs=UNIDRV.OEM,TTFSUB.OEM
```

In Windows Vista, package-aware drivers should use the new **CoreDriverSections** keyword when referring to Unidrv files, as shown in the following section of an INF file for Windows Vista:

```cpp
[UniDrvInstall_Vista]
CopyFiles=@OEMRES.DLL,@OEMABC.GPD
DataFile=OEMABC.GPD
CoreDriverSections="{D20EA372-DD35-4950-9ED8-A6335AFE79F0}, 
 UNIDRV.OEM, UNIDRV_DATA, TTFSUB.OEM"
```

As of Windows Vista, do not include Ntprint.inf because Unidrv is packaged as a core driver and is referred to by its globally unique identifier (GUID). When using core drivers, do not use the **DataSection** keyword, but instead refer to this section from the **CoreDriverSections** keyword.

Core print package files are listed in the following table.

<table>
<colgroup>
<col width="50%" />
<col width="50%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Core File</th>
<th>GUID</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>UNIDRV</p></td>
<td><p>{D20EA372-DD35-4950-9ED8-A6335AFE79F0}</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>PSCRIPT</p></td>
<td><p>{D20EA372-DD35-4950-9ED8-A6335AFE79F1}</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>PCLXL</p></td>
<td><p>{D20EA372-DD35-4950-9ED8-A6335AFE79F2}</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>PLOTTER</p></td>
<td><p>{D20EA372-DD35-4950-9ED8-A6335AFE79F4}</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>XPSDRV</p></td>
<td><p>{D20EA372-DD35-4950-9ED8-A6335AFE79F5}</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

 

More than one core driver section can be referenced; for example:

```cpp
CoreDriverSections="{GUID1}, SectionName1, SectionName2", "{GUID2}, SectionName3"
```

When installing a driver that depends on a core driver, the print installer will look for the latest version of that core driver in the driver store and will install the newest version.
