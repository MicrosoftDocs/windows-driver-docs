# Bidirectional Communication Error Codes


The following error codes are used in printer bidirectional communication.

| Value                               | Description                                                                                            |
|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ERROR\_BIDI\_DEVICE\_OFFLINE        | The bidi call is supported but the connection to the remote printer is not available.                  |
| ERROR\_BIDI\_ERROR\_BASE            | The bidi call completed successfully, but there are one or more errors in the individual responses.    |
| ERROR\_BIDI\_NOT\_SUPPORTED         | The bidi call is not supported by the port monitor or print provider.                                  |
| ERROR\_BIDI\_SCHEMA\_NOT\_SUPPORTED | A caller tried to access a bidi schema that is not supported by the port monitor or the print provider |
| ERROR\_BIDI\_SCHEMA\_READ\_ONLY     | A caller tried to set a read-only attribute.                                                           |
| ERROR\_BIDI\_SERVER\_OFFLINE        | The bidi call is supported but the connection to the remote printer server is not available.           |
| ERROR\_BIDI\_STATUS\_OK             | The bidi call completed successfully.                                                                  |
| ERROR\_BIDI\_STATUS\_WARNING        | The bidi call completed successfully, but there are one or more errors in the individual responses.    |
| ERROR\_NO\_DATA                     | The bidi schema is unknown.                                                                            |
