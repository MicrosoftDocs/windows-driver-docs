# Unidrv/PScript5 XPSDrv UI Behavior Changes

[!include[Print Support Apps](../includes/print-support-apps.md)]

A Unidrv/PScript5 driver that is running in XPSDrv mode will create the following core driver default UI behavior changes. (In the following table, "PS only" means the behavior change is specific to a PScript5 driver. "Unidrv only" means the behavior change is specific to Unidrv driver. If both of these phrases do not appear, the behavior change applies to both Unidrv and PScript5 drivers.)
