# Additive Template Directive


The \***Additive**: directive defines the order of template definitions.

The **Additive** directive can have one of the following values:

-   MOST\_RECENT. Only the most recent definition appears.

-   LEAST\_RECENT. Only the least recent (first) definition appears.

-   MOST\_TO\_LEAST\_RECENT. All definitions appear ordered from most to least recent.

-   LEAST\_TO\_MOST\_RECENT. All definitions appear ordered from least to most recent.

If this directive is absent, a default value of MOST\_RECENT will be assumed.

If this directive is itself multiply defined within a template or appears in several templates that are related by inheritance, only the most recently defined directive in the most derived template will be honored.
