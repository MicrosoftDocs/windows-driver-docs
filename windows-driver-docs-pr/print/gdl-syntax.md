# GDL Syntax


The GDL parser processes a stream of GDL entries. Each entry is delimited by a linebreak sequence or a construct delimiter. The GDL stream might exist in a single file or might be constructed by a sequence of files that are logically equivalent to a stream that is contained in a single file.

There are two types of GDL entries: attributes and constructs. *GDL attributes* are simple pairs of keywords and values. *GDL constructs* contain a GDL attribute followed by a collection of data entries called a *construct*. A collection of constructs is separated by a series of *construct delimiters.*

Whitespace characters can appear between GDL entries, and comments can appear in GDL streams.

GDL uses strings to represent data.
