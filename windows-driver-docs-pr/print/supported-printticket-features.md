# Supported PrintTicket Features

[!include[Print Support Apps](../includes/print-support-apps.md)]

This section provides information about the PrintTicket features that are supported by the standard XPS filters.

All these features have the effect of causing the XPS filter to vary the PDL commands that are generated. Whether the PDL commands are generated by the filter itself or they are specified by the device GPD/PPD, these features still cause the XPS filter to vary the PDL commands. All the elements (Features, Options, ScoredProperties, Parameters) that are referenced in the following sections can be found in the print schema keywords (psk) namespace.

## PageMediaSize

This Feature describes the dimensions of the media sheet used for the printed output. In addition to the name, each Option can contain two Scored Properties: MediaSizeWidth and MediaSizeHeight. These describe the physical size of the media. Supported Options are any options with a corresponding GPD/PPD file entry.

For PCL6/GPD, if the PrintTicket option is CustomMediaSize, then the PageMediaSizeMediaSizeWith and PageMediaSizeMediaSizeHeight parameters are used to obtain the dimensions of the media.

For PostScript/PPD, if the PrintTicket option is PSCustomMediaSize then the PageMediaSizePSWith and PageMediaSizePSHeight parameters are used to obtain the dimensions of the media. The PCL6 generated for the selected media type is specified by the GPD PageSize Feature value. The following list shows the order in which the GPD is examined to determine the PageMediaSize option to use:

1. If PrintSchemaKeywordMap is specified and matches the name attribute of the PageMediaSize Option.

1. The following [Default PageMediaSize mappings](default-pagemediasize-mappings.md) are used.

1. The name attribute of the PageSize Option matches the name of the Option in the GPD.

During the rendering process, the filter will replace PhysPaperWidth in any GPD command with the width of the paper specified by the MediaSizeWidth ScoredProperty or the PageMediaSizeMediaSizeWidth Parameter.

The filter will also replace PhysPaperLength in any GPD command with the length of the paper specified by the MediaSizeHeight ScoredProperty or the PageMediaSizeMediaSizeHeight Parameter.

The PostScript generated for the selected media type is specified by the PPD PageSize Feature. The Option in the PPD to use is selected in the following order:

1. If MSPrintSchemaKeywordMap is specified and matches the name attribute of the PageMediaSize Option.

1. The name attribute of the PageSize Option matches the name of the Option in the PPD.

The PostScript generated for the selected copies is determined by the filter. See the JobCollateAllDocuments feature for interaction with this parameter.

## DocumentCopiesAllPages

This parameter specifies the number of page copies the associated document in the print job should output.

The PCL6 generated for the selected copies is determined by the filter. See the DocumentCollate feature for interaction with this parameter.

The PostScript generated for the selected copies is determined by the filter. See the DocumentCollate feature for interaction with this parameter.

## PageCopies

This parameter specifies how many copies of an individual source document page within a document should be output. Since the copy count only applies to the current page there is no collation.

The PCL6 generated for the selected copies is determined by the filter.

The PostScript generated for the selected copies is determined by the filter.

## DocumentCollate

This feature specifies the order in which the pages of the associated document in the print job appear in the printed output. The supported options are Collated and Uncollated.

The PCL6 generated for the selected collation is specified by the GPD Collate feature. The option in the GPD to use is selected in the following order:

1. If PrintSchemaKeywordMap is specified and matches the name attribute of the DocumentCollate Option.

1. The following default mappings are used:

    | DocumentCollate value | GPD/PPD file entry |
    |---|---|
    | PrintTicket Uncollated | GPD OFF |
    | PrintTicket Collated | GPD ON |

1. The name attribute of the DocumentCollate option matches the name of the option in the GPD.

When DocumentCollate is set to Collated and the GPD Collate option contains a command, then it is assumed that the device can generate the collated copies. The *XPS.PCL6* filter will only generate 1 copy of the job and use the GPD command to instruct the device to generate the collated copies. The filter then replaces NumOfCopies in the GPD command with the number of copies specified by JobCopiesAllDocuments.

The PostScript generated for the selected collation is specified by the PPD Collate feature. The Option in the PPD to use is selected in the following order:

1. If MSPrintSchemaKeywordMap is specified and matches the name attribute of the DocumentCollate Option.

1. The name attribute of the DocumentCollate Option matches the name of the Option in the PPD.

When DocumentCollate is set to Collated and the PPD contains the Collate feature, or a feature which is keyword mapped to DocumentCollate, then it is assumed that the device can generate the collated copies. The XPS.PS filter will only generate 1 copy of the job and use the PPD command to instruct the device to generate the collated copies.

This feature specifies that the content of multiple pages should be printed onto each sheet of the physical media. And the printing should be done in such a way that the content from different documents is not printed onto the same sheet. The Print Schema Specification does not specify a name for this Option; however the Option does support the ScoredProperty and PagesPerSheet values that specify the number of pages that will be placed on one side of the physical media. The supported values of PagesPerSheet are 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 16, 25 and 32 with the physical page orientation being rotated for 2, 6, 8, 12 and 32.

Content on the top that now falls outside the printable area will be clipped.

The binding edge is the specified edge based on the orientation of the first page of the first document in the job. For all other options, BindingGutter is ignored.

If the GPD file does not specify a command for the selected option, then the PCL6 generated for the selected binding is determined by the filter.
