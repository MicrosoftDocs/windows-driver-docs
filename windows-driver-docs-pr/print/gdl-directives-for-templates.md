# GDL Directives for Templates


GDL has template directives that define the GDL schema by using templates.

GDL contains the following template directive:

-   **\*Template** defines a template construct.

Several other directives are used within the template construct to complete the definition. The following lists describes some of the directives that are used within the template construct:

-   **\*Name** is the name of the data entry keyword to bind to.

-   **\*Inherits** inherits the properties of the specified template.

-   **\*Members** uses the specified template trees in the binding process.

-   **\*Type** is the type of object that this template defines.

-   **\*Production**, **\*Member**, and **\*Occurs** define the content that is allowed for a construct. Note that the content depends on the configuration.

-   **\*Additive** describes which definition of an entry shall be shown in the snapshot if the entry is multiply defined.

-   **\*ValueType** assigns a data type to the value of an attribute.

-   **\*DataType**, **\*ElementType**, **\*ArrayLabel**, and **\*ElementTags** define the data types.
