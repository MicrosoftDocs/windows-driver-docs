# Command Names





The GPD language defines a unique command name for each common printer command. Additionally, it defines the CmdSelect command name for specifying commands used for selecting [printer options](printer-options.md).

The following topics list all of the defined command names:

[General Printing Commands](general-printing-commands.md)

[Printer Configuration Commands](printer-configuration-commands.md)

[Option Selection Command](option-selection-command.md)

[Text Printing Commands](text-printing-commands.md)

[Raster Printing Commands](raster-printing-commands.md)

[Vector Printing Commands](vector-printing-commands.md)
