[!include[Print Support Apps](../includes/print-support-apps.md)]

This section describes how to add Print Ticket processing to the rendering parts of a print driver and the descriptions in this section refer to filters in an XPSDrv print driver. XPSDrv filter module implementation is described in the [XPS Filter Pipeline](xpsdrv-printer-driver.md) section.
