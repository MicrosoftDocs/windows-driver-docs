# Plug and Play for Printers





This section describes the design of Plug and Play for printers in Microsoft Windows 2000 and later. Printing Plug and Play design is similar to the Windows 95 design. Windows 2000 and later operating system versions support Plug and Play for printers attached to LPT ports, USB ports, infrared ports, and parallel ports.

There are three system components responsible for Plug and Play printer installation:

1.  [Printer Installation and the Plug and Play Manager](printer-installation-and-the-plug-and-play-manager.md)

2.  [Plug and Play Bus Enumerators](plug-and-play-bus-enumerators.md)

3.  [Installing a Custom Plug and Play Printer Driver](installing-a-custom-plug-and-play-printer-driver.md)
