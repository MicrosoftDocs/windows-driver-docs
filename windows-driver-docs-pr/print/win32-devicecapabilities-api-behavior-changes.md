# Win32 DeviceCapabilities API behavior changes

[!include[Print Support Apps](../includes/print-support-apps.md)]

A Unidrv/PScript5 driver that is running in XPSDrv mode creates the following changes in the Microsoft Win32 **DeviceCapabilities** function.

When a GPD/PPD feature or option is mapped to a Print Schema keyword by using GPD's **PrintSchemaKeywordMap** or PPD's **MSPrintSchemaKeywordMap** keywords, GPD or PPD supports that print schema keyword.

(In the following table, "PS only" means the behavior change is specific to a PScript5 driver. "Unidrv only" means the behavior change is specific to Unidrv driver. If both of these phrases don't appear, the behavior change applies to both Unidrv and PScript5 drivers.)

| Capability | Non-XPSDrv behavior | XPSDrv behavior |
|--|--|--|
| DC_COPIES | (Unidrv only) When EMF is enabled, **DeviceCapabilitiesreturns** a hard-coded value that is the maximum value of 9999 or the GPD file's specified \*MaxCopies value.<br><br>When EMF is disabled, **DeviceCapabilities** returns the GPD*MaxCopies value.<br><br>(PS only) **DeviceCapabilities** returns a hard-coded value of 9999. | (Unidrv only) **DeviceCapabilities** returns the GPD \*MaxCopies value.<br><br>(PS only) **DeviceCapabilities** returns the PPD file's \*MSXPSMaxCopies value or 1 if the value isn't specified in the PPD file. |
| DC_TRUETYPE | For Unidrv, if the \*FontFormat GPD keyword is specified, **DeviceCapabilities** returns (DCTT_BITMAP \| DCTT_DOWNLOAD); otherwise, **DeviceCapabilities** returns DCTT_BITMAP.<br><br>For PS, DeviceCapabilities always returns (DCTT_DOWNLOAD \| DCTT_SUBDEV). | If GPD or PPD supports a feature with the "PageDeviceFontSubstitution" Print Schema keyword, the DCTT_SUBDEV flag is set in the return value.<br><br>If GPD or PPD supports a feature with the "PageTrueTypeFontMode" Print Schema keyword, the following occur:<br><br>If the feature supports an option with the "DownloadAsOutlineFont" Print Schema keyword, both the DCTT_DOWNLOAD and DCTT_DOWNLOAD_OUTLINE flags are set in the return value.<br><br>If the feature supports an option with the "Automatic", "DownloadAsRasterFont", or "DownloadAsNativeTrueTypeFont" Print Schema keyword, the DCTT_DOWNLOAD flag is set in the return value.<br><br>If the feature supports an option with the "RenderAsBitmap" Print Schema keyword, the DCTT_BITMAP flag is set in the return value.<br><br>If none of the DCTT_Xxx flags are set, **DeviceCapabilities** returns 0. |
| DC_ORIENTATION | (PS only) **DeviceCapabilities** returns 90 or 270 based on PPD's \*LandscapeOrientation value and setting for the hard-coded Rotated Landscape orientation option in the input DEVMODE structure. | (PS only) The default return value is 0, which means that there's no landscape orientation.<br><br>If PPD supports a feature with the "PageOrientation" Print Schema keyword, the following occur:<br><br>If the feature supports an option with the "Landscape" Print Schema keyword, **DeviceCapabilities** returns 90.<br><br>If the feature supports an option with the "ReverseLandscape" Print Schema keyword, **DeviceCapabilities** returns 270. |
| DC_COLLATE | When EMF is enabled, **DeviceCapabilities** is hardcoded to return 1 (which means that collating is supported).<br><br>When EMF is disabled, **DeviceCapabilities** returns 1 if GPD or PPD specifies Collate as a supported feature and if the Collate GPD or PPD feature isn't constrained by any device setting features. Otherwise, **DeviceCapabilities** returns 0. | The behavior is the same as for non-XPSDrv drivers with EMF disabled. |
| DC_NUP | **DeviceCapabilities** returns a hard-coded value to indicate support for 1, 2, 4, 6, 9, or 16 ups. | If GPD or PPD defines a feature with the "DocumentNUp" Print Schema keyword (the "DocumentNUp" feature is only used if no "JobNUpAllDocumentsContiguously" feature exists), then for any options of that feature that have the option GPD/PPD keyword name as a numeric number (that is, 1, 2, 6, and so on), the numeric number is reported as one of the supported pages per sheet value.<br><br>Otherwise, XPSDrv reports that NUp isn't supported. |
| DC_PERSONALITY | Unidrv returns the string defined by *Personality or*rcPersonalityID GPD keyword.<br><br>PS always returns "PostScript". | Keep the behavior the same as it is for non-XPSDrv drivers. |
| DC_MEDIAREADY | If the Form-Tray assignment table is ever created, DeviceCapabilities returns the unique form names that are listed in the table that has an assigned tray.<br><br>If Form-Tray assignment table isn't created, **DeviceCapabilities** returns "Letter" for nonmetric system default locale, "A4" for metric system default locale, or a GPD or PPD defined default paper size if the printer doesn't support "Letter" and "A4". | The behavior is the same as with non-XPSDrv with no form-tray assignment table created. |
| DC_STAPLE | (PS only) PPD doesn't have a single "Stapling" feature. A PScript5 driver checks if any of following PPD features are defined in PPD and not constrained by device settings to determine if the device can support stapling.<br><br>"StapleLocation"<br>"StapleX", "StapleY"<br>"StapleWhen"<br>"StapleOrientation" | (PS only) If PPD supports a feature with the "JobStapleAllDocuments" or "DocumentStaple" Print Schema keyword, DeviceCapabilities returns 1 to indicate supporting stapling. Otherwise, DeviceCapabilities returns 0. |
