# Writing a Print Monitor





Print monitors are responsible for directing a print data stream from the print spooler to an appropriate port driver. Two types of print monitors are defined -- [language monitors](language-monitors.md) and [port monitors](port-monitors.md). This section describes both monitor types, and provides design and implementation guidelines.

The following topics are provided:

[Port Monitors](port-monitors.md)
