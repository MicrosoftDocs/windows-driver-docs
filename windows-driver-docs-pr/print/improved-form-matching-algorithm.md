# Improved Form Matching Algorithm


In Windows Vista, the form matching algorithm in the Unidrv printer driver is also improved to find the form that best matches the search criteria when determining if the driver can support a requested form.

In Windows Vista, support for localized names has been improved by using a more precise and language-independent search criteria to find forms in the forms database. For situations when the server and the client computer use a different language, the new method works better than the method that was used in previous versions of Windows.
