# UWP device apps for printers (print)

[!include[Print Support Apps](../includes/print-support-apps.md)]

UWP device apps for printers allow IHVs to highlight the special features of their devices through customized printer preferences and notification support.

UWP device apps are distributed by the Microsoft Store and automatically installed for users who have opted in to download applications. UWP device apps for printers may be provided for any printer on Windows.

Printers that are installed using v4 print drivers can provide a customized printer preferences experience by supporting the printTaskSettings contract or support printer notifications by supporting the backgroundTasks contract. For more information, see [Developing a UWP device app for printing](../devapps/uwp-device-apps-for-printers.md).
