# Print Ticket


A PrintTicket document is an XML document that describes how a document or document part is to be printed. A PrintTicket document can be associated with a print job, a document, or a page within a document. The PrintTicket document can be added to an XPS Document as a PrintTicket part and saved with document contents in a file. A PrintTicket document can also be added to a document as the application spools the document for printing.
