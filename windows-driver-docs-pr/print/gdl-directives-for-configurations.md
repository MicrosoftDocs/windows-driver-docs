# GDL Directives for Configurations


GDL has directives that define and work with configurations.

GDL contains the following configuration directives:

-   **\*Feature** defines a configuration parameter that relates to features.

-   **\*Option** defines a set of allowed states that can be assigned to each configuration parameter. These allowed states are known as *options*.

-   **\*Switch**, **\*Case**, and **Default** establish a dependency on a specified configuration parameter.

-   **\*DefaultOption** constructs a default configuration.

-   **\*Constraints** and **\*InvalidCombinations** specify invalid configurations. If these directives are encountered, the GDL parser will attempt to modify them to create a valid (or unconstrained) configuration.

For more information about configuration directives, see [GDL Configurations](gdl-configurations.md).
