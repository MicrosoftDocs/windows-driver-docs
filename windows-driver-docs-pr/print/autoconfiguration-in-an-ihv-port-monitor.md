# Autoconfiguration in an IHV port monitor

An IHV who intends to develop a port monitor must design it to support autoconfiguration. To provide support for autoconfiguration in an IHV port monitor, follow these guidelines:

- Implement the [**SendRecvBidiDataFromPort**](/previous-versions/ff562071(v=vs.85)) function and place the address of this function in the **pfnSendRecvBidiDataFromPort** member of the [**MONITOR2**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/winsplp/ns-winsplp-_monitor2) structure.

- Support the [bidi communications schema](./bidi-communications-schema-reference.md).

- Support bidi notifications.

An IHV is not required to develop a port monitor if in-box support is sufficient. (For details, see [In-box support for autoconfiguration](in-box-support-for-autoconfiguration.md).) Be aware that in-box support is provided only for the standard TCP/IP port monitor and the Web Services for Devices (WSD) port monitor. IHVs who intend to provide autoconfiguration for local printers must provide a port monitor.
