# Miscellaneous GDL Directives


GDL provides two miscellaneous directives:

-   \*IgnoreBlock causes the GDL parser to ignore the value and contents of the construct.

-   \*% (asterisk plus the percent sign) causes the parser to ignore the remainder of the line. You can use this directive for adding a comment.
