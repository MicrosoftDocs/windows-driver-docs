# Sample Rendering Plug-Ins

[!include[Print Support Apps](../includes/print-support-apps.md)]

Source code for sample rendering plug-ins are provided with the WDK for Windows 7. Code is contained in the \\src\\print\\oemdll\\oemuni and \\src\\print\\oemdll\\oemps source code subdirectories. The code in the first subdirectory creates a plug-in that you can use with *Unidrv*. The code in the second subdirectory creates a plug-in that you can use with *Pscript*.
