# Sample UI Plug-In

[!include[Print Support Apps](../includes/print-support-apps.md)]

Source code for a sample user interface plug-in is provided with the Windows Driver Kit (WDK) for Windows 7. Code is contained in the \\src\\print\\oemdll\\oemui source code subdirectory and creates a plug-in that you can use with either *Unidrv* or *Pscript*.
