# Configurations for Creating Snapshots


A configuration is nothing more than a list of parameters and the current value that is assigned to each parameter. The GDL parser interface expects the configuration to be in XML, but to simplify, the following pseudocode example shows a typical representation of a configuration by using a list of parameter-value pairs.

```cpp
Today: Sunday
Weather: Cloudy
```
