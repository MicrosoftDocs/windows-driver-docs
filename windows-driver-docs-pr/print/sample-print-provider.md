# Sample Print Provider





**Warning**  
Starting with Windows 10, the APIs which support third-party print providers are deprecated. Microsoft does not recommend any investment into third-party print providers. Additionally, on Windows 8 and newer products where the v4 print driver model is available, third-party print providers may not create or manage queues which use v4 print drivers.

 

A sample print provider is included with the Windows Driver Kit (WDK). The sample is not a fully functioning print provider; it is a template containing skeletal implementations of the [functions defined by print providers](functions-defined-by-print-providers.md). Sample files are located in the \\Src\\Print\\Pp subdirectory of the WDK.
