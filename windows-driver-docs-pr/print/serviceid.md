# ServiceID


The `ServiceID` command returns the service identifier (ID) in the form of the function discovery key, PNP\_PNPX\_ServiceID. The output buffer contains a NULL-terminated string that represents the URI.

For more information about function discovery keys, see the Microsoft Windows SDK documentation.
