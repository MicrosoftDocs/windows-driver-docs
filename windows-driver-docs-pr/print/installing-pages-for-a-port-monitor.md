# Installing Pages for a Port Monitor





You can provide a customized printer details page for use with printers that do not use the standard TCP/IP port monitor. Place the page's ASP file, along with all subordinate files (such as .gif files or ASP files for linked pages), in the monitor's subdirectory (&lt;Root&gt;\\&lt;Monitor&gt;, where &lt;Monitor&gt; matches the monitor name returned in a PORT\_INFO\_2 structure; for more information, see the Microsoft Windows SDK documentation). Your monitor's installer program must perform this task.

The page's initial ASP file must be named Page1.asp. All ASP file names with a format of Page*N*.asp, where *N* is 1, 2, 3, and so on, are reserved by Microsoft.
