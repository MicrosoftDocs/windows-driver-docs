# Boolean Values

[!include[Print Support Apps](../includes/print-support-apps.md)]

Boolean values are defined as being equal to either of the predefined constants **TRUE** or **FALSE**. By convention, the symbolic names of all [printer attributes](printer-attributes.md) that accept Boolean values end with a question mark character, as the following example illustrates:

```cpp
*RotateRasterData?: FALSE
```
