# V4 Driver INF

[!include[Print Support Apps](../includes/print-support-apps.md)]

The v4 print driver setup model continues to use INF files, but also employs a new manifest file to capture the printer specific setup directives.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Starting with the WDK for Windows 11, version 22H2, WDF redistributable co-installers are no longer supported.
> To learn how to work around this change, see [WDF redistributable co-installers don't work](/windows-hardware/drivers/wdk-known-issues#wdf-redistributable-co-installers-dont-work) in the *WDK known issues* article.

## Sample INF

Notice that the sample v4 print driver INF file presented in this topic does not contain any printer-specific directives. The printer-specific instructions are contained in the v4 manifest file, which is always named ending with "â€“manifest.ini". Each driver within a driver package may specify its own v4 manifest file.

The following sample INF file assumes that a fictional company, Fabrikam, has manufactured print devices that will be installed to run with the v4 print driver.

```inf

## INF Directives

The following table shows the list of printer-specific directives that are permitted in v4 print drivers and print class drivers.

| Directive | Description | Restrictions | Usage |
|--|--|--|--|
| ClassVer | Used to indicate that a printer class driver is v4. | V4 print drivers must specify ClassVer=4.0. V3 print drivers may specify ClassVer=3.0, but it is optional. No other values are supported at this time. | ClassVer=4.0 |

## The DestinationDirs Keyword

The v4 driver INF requires that **DestinationDir** is specified for all files in the package. The supported **DestinationDir** values are listed in the following table.

| DestinationDir ID | Description |
|--|--|
| 66000 | [This Destination ID has been overloaded for the v4 driver]<br><br>V4: This must be set as the DefaultDestDir for a v4 print driver. Specifies that the files should be run from the Driver Store.<br><br>V3: This specifies that files should be installed to the \3 directory. |
| 23 | V4: This must be set as the **DestinationDir** for any color profiles.<br><br>V3: Color profiles should be installed using the printer-specific DirID 66003. |

## INF Restrictions

V4 print drivers must not define other printer-specific directives or keywords called out in the following list.

### NTPrint References

NTPrint references are made in the manifest file. The INF file does not require any information about the NTPrint references in its DDInstall, CopyFiles, or SourceDisksFiles sections.

### Configuration Module References

All print drivers use the same configuration module binary (PrintConfig.dll); there is no mechanism for a driver to select the configuration module.
