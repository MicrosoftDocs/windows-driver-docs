# Package-Aware Print Drivers that Do Not Share Files

[!include[Print Support Apps](../includes/print-support-apps.md)]

When the files in the driver package are uniquely named and do not occur in any other driver package, add a PrinterPackageInstallation section to the INF file. In that section, add the **PackageAware**=TRUE keyword as shown in line 23 of the following example:

```inf
[Version]
Signature="$Windows NT$"
Class=Printer
ClassGUID={4D36E979-E325-11CE-BFC1-08002BE10318}

;Models section for installation of x86 driver on

DataFile=OEMABC.GPD

[PrinterPackageInstallation.x86]
PackageAware=TRUE
