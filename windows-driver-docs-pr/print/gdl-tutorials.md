# GDL Tutorials

This section includes several exercises that describe the design and definition of some simple schemas and their implementation through GDL templates. The exercises also consider several schema extension scenarios.

You can verify the correctness of each solution by using the GDL Correctness Test, which is part of the [Windows Hardware Certification Kit (HCK) (EXE download)](https://download.microsoft.com/download/1/8/B/18BC088A-537D-4386-9334-687747A602E6/hlk/hlksetup.exe).

> [!NOTE]
> The HCK is not for use with Windows 10.
> If you are developing hardware or drivers for Windows 10, you need the new [Windows Hardware Lab Kit (HLK)](/windows-hardware/test/hlk/windows-hardware-lab-kit) for Windows 10.
