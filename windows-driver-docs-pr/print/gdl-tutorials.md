# GDL Tutorials


This section includes several exercises that describe the design and definition of some simple schemas and their implementation through GDL templates. The exercises also consider several schema extension scenarios.

You can verify the correctness of each solution by using the GDL Correctness Test, which is part of the [Windows Hardware Certification Kit (HCK)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=733613).
