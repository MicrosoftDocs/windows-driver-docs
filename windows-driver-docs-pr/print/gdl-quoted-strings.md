# GDL Quoted Strings


A *quoted string* begins and ends with the double quotation character ("). Any characters that appear between will be treated literally as part of the quoted string with the following exceptions:

-   A percent sign plus a double quotation mark (%") is treated as a literal double quotation character (").

-   A percent sign plus a less than symbol (%&lt;) is treated as a literal less than symbol (&lt;).

-   A percent sign followed by any other character is treated as a literal percent sign (%).

-   The less than symbol (&lt;) introduces a [HexSubString](gdl-hexsubstrings.md) context.

-   Quoted strings can appear within a nested context; only the HexSubString context is recognized within a quoted string.
