# Implementing Printer Driver COM Interfaces

[!include[Print Support Apps](../includes/print-support-apps.md)]

This section explains how to construct a plug-in, based on WDK-supplied sample code. It also explains the calling sequences used for communication between the printer drivers and plug-ins. This section includes the following topics:
