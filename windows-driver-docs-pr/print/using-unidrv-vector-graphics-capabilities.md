# Using Unidrv Vector Graphics Capabilities

[!include[Print Support Apps](../includes/print-support-apps.md)]

On Microsoft Windows XP and later, Unidrv provides support for two types of vector graphics printers: HP-GL/2 monochrome (PCL-5e), or PCL XL monochrome (PCL-6). On Microsoft Windows Server 2003 and later, Unidrv also supports PCL XL color (PCL-6). There is also pseudovector graphics support for graphics printers that do not have vector rendering capabilities.
