# \#Else Conditional Preprocessor Directive


```GDL
#Else:
```

The \#Else directive defines the end of the previous section and the start of a new conditional section. The section is preserved if no previous section in the construct has been preserved. Otherwise, it is deleted. No symbol is used.
