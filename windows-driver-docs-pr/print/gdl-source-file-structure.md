# GDL Source File Structure


GDL entries can be [attributes](gdl-attributes.md) or [constructs](gdl-constructs.md). An *attribute* is a [keyword](gdl-keywords.md)-[value](gdl-values.md) pair. A *construct* is an object that can hold zero or more GDL entries (which might be attributes or constructs or a combination of both) and is itself associated with a keyword-value pair.
