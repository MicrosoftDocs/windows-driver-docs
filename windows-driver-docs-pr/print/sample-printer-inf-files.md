# Sample Printer INF Files





A sample printer INF file is supplied with the Windows Driver Kit (WDK), located in the \\src\\print\\infs\\driver5 subdirectory. This file is a template that illustrates the layout of INF files used for installing Unidrv and Pscript minidrivers. Replace the place-holder file names with the names of your driver files.
