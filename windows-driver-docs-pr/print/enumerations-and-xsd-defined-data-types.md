# Enumerations and XSD-Defined Data Types


Enumerations that are defined by using GDL templates cause enumeration data type definitions to appear in the XSD schema that is generated by the GDL parser. XSD-defined data types that use GDL templates cause XSD data type definitions to appear in the XSD schema that is generated by the GDL parser.
