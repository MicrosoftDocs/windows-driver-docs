# ASP Files for Print Web Pages





Print Web pages are created by using ASP files. Microsoft provides ASP files that create the following print Web pages:

- A print server page that is referenced by the URL https://<em>&lt;ServerName&gt;</em>/printers, where *&lt;ServerName&gt;* represents the DNS or WINS name for a print server. This page contains links to a page for every printer installed on the server.

- A print queue page for each of the server's print queues. These pages are accessible by links in the print server page, or they can be referenced directly from a browser using the URL https://<em>&lt;ServerName&gt;</em>/*&lt;ShareName&gt;*.

- Additional pages for queued documents, printer properties, and printer-specific details. These pages are displayed within a frame of the print queue page.

The printer-specific details page can be customized by replacing its ASP file. For more information, see [Customizing the Printer Details Web Page](customizing-the-printer-details-web-page.md).
