# GDL Keywords


A *GDL keyword* is a token that consists of characters from the set \[A-Z, a-z, 0-9, \*, \_, ?\]. By convention, most keywords begin with an asterisk (\*). There is no limit to the length of a keyword.

A GDL keyword is required for any GDL entry. The keyword is followed by an optional [value](gdl-values.md). If a value is supplied, the keyword and value must be separated by a colon (:). Optional [whitespace characters](gdl-whitespace-characters.md) can also appear between the keyword and value.
