# Directory Services for printers

When a user installs a network-shared printer, the print folder, by default, also publishes the printer to Directory Services. Publication is accomplished by calling the spooler's **SetPrinter** function with an input structure of [**PRINTER_INFO_7**](/windows/win32/printdocs/printer-info-7).

Publishing a print queue makes it visible to users through the **Search** option on the task bar's **Start** menu.

The following topics provide more information about printer support for Directory Services:
