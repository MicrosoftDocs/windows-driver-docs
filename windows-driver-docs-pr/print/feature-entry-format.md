# Feature entry format

[!include[Print Support Apps](../includes/print-support-apps.md)]

To specify a printer feature entry in a GPD file, use the following format:

\*Feature: *FeatureName* {*FeatureAttributes*}

where *FeatureName* is the name of either one of the predefined [standard features](standard-features.md) or a customized feature name, and *FeatureAttributes* is a set of [feature attributes](feature-attributes.md).

For example, a GPD file might contain the following specification of the standard InputBin feature.

```GPD
*Feature: InputBin
{
    *Name: "Paper Bin"
    *DefaultOption: Upper
    *Option: Upper
    {
        *Name: "Upper Tray"
        *Command: CmdSelect
        {
            *Order: DOC_SETUP.10
            *Cmd: "<1B>&l1H"
        }
        *Constraints: PaperSize.Env10
    }
    *Option: Manual
    {
        *Name: "Manual Feed"
        *Command: CmdSelect
        {
            *Order: DOC_SETUP.10
            *Cmd: "<1B>&l2H"
        }
        *Installable?: TRUE
    }
}
```

If you repeat a feature specification by, for example, including two or more InputBin feature entries, then the following rules apply:

- Attributes and options that are not duplicated are added to Unidrv's database.

- Attributes and options that are duplicated are overwritten, and Unidrv retains only the last specification.

You can control the order in which features are displayed to the user. See [Specifying Feature and Option Display Order](specifying-feature-and-option-display-order.md).
