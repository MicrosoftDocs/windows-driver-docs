# Identifying a Printer's Color Capability

[!include[Print Support Apps](../includes/print-support-apps.md)]

To distinguish between color and noncolor (monochrome or grayscale) devices, Windows 2000 and later NT-based operating system versions call the [**DrvDeviceCapabilities**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/winddiui/nf-winddiui-drvdevicecapabilities) function, passing the DC\_COLORDEVICE constant in the call. This function returns 1 if the device supports color, and 0 if the device produces monochrome or grayscale output. It is recommended that all printer drivers support calls to **DrvDeviceCapabilities** for the DC\_COLORDEVICE constant.

It is very important for drivers to implement the [**DrvDeviceCapabilities**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/winddiui/nf-winddiui-drvdevicecapabilities) function. Otherwise it is more difficult for the operating system to distinguish between color and noncolor devices, for the following reasons:

- A call to the **GetDeviceCaps** function (described in the Windows SDK documentation), in which the NUMCOLORS constant is passed, usually results in a return value less than or equal to 2 for most noncolor devices, and greater than 2 for color devices. The operating system is unable to distinguish between monochrome and grayscale devices.

- The value of the **dmColor** member of the [**DEVMODEW**](/windows/win32/api/wingdi/ns-wingdi-devmodew) structure is not a reliable indicator of whether the device is a color or noncolor device. Certain printer drivers set this member to DMCOLOR\_COLOR even for devices that are not capable of producing color.
