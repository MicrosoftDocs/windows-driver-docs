# GDL Miscellaneous Macros


GDL uses a **\*IgnoreBlock** directive to disable processing of the contents of the construct. This directive is useful when implementing divide and conquer debugging strategies or to comment out obsolete code. The contents of **\*IgnoreBlock** must still conform to the basic syntax rules. Invalid GDL or large comment blocks can be enclosed within &lt;Begin/EndValue:&gt; delimiters and made the value of the **\*IgnoreBlock**.

The following code example shows how to use **\*IgnoreBlock**.

```cpp
*IgnoreBlock: <BeginValue:garbage> The code in between does not even need to be valid GDL. }{ " % !!! 
This directive is great for large blocks of comments 
or when you do not want to mark each line with *%  <EndValue:garbage> {}
```
