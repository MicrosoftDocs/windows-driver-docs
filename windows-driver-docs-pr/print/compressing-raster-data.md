# Compressing Raster Data

[!include[Print Support Apps](../includes/print-support-apps.md)]

Unidrv supports raster data compression using the following three formats:

- Tagged Image File Format (TIFF), version 4.0

- Delta-Row Compression (DRC)

- East Asian Run-Length Encoding (FE-RLE)

These methods are defined in the *HP PCL 5 Printer Language Technical Reference*. (This resource may not be available in some languages and countries.)

You can include entries in a GPD file to indicate which of these compression formats your printer supports. You can also provide your own compression algorithm.
