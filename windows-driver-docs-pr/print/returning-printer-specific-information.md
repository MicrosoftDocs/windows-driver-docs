# Returning Printer-Specific Information

[!include[Print Support Apps](../includes/print-support-apps.md)]

GDI sometimes requests a printer graphics DLL to return printer-specific information in between print jobs, by calling such **DrvQuery**-prefixed graphics DDI functions as [**DrvQueryAdvanceWidths**](/windows/win32/api/winddi/nf-winddi-drvqueryadvancewidths) (if defined by the graphics DLL).

An example of when this might occur is the case of a word processing application that is maintaining a WYSIWYG screen display of a printable page. To correctly display the line breaks in text, the word processor must base line-fitting calculations on character widths and other font metrics from the selected printer's implementation of a font.
