# Web Services for Devices Print Service Schema


WindowsÂ Vista and later Windows operating systems provide Web Services on devices as a connection protocol with printing and scanning peripherals.

Web Services technology provides a common framework for describing and sharing information. Web Services on devices, part of the Windows Rally program, describes a set of protocols for consuming and controlling services on network-connected devices.

Four Web Services specifications exist for printing and scanning, to help device manufacturers take advantage of the improved customer experience around connecting, installing, and using devices with Windows.

For more information about the specifications for the four Web Services, see [Implementing Web Services on Devices for Printing and Scanning](/windows-hardware/design/whitepapers/implementing-web-services-on-devices-for-printing).

The WSD Print Service schema conforms to the WSD subset of the Printer Working Group (PWG) Semantic Model, which provides elemental descriptions for printers, jobs, and documents.
