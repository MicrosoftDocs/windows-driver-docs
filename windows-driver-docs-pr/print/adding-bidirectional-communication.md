# Add bidirectional communication

The spooler provides support for bidirectional ("BiDi") communication between an application or driver and a printer. This support enables the application or driver to send one or more requests to the printer, and the printer to respond to these requests.

## Bidirectional communication requirements

Before an application or driver can use bidi communication, it must implement [bidirectional communication interfaces](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/_print/index): either the **IBidiSpl** COM interface or the **IbidiSpl2** COM interface, together with at least one of the **IBidiRequest** and **IBidiRequestContainer** COM interfaces. In addition, one or both of the following must be true:

- The [**SendRecvBidiData**](/previous-versions/ff562068(v=vs.85)) function is implemented in a print provider DLL.

- The [**SendRecvBidiDataFromPort**](/previous-versions/ff562071(v=vs.85)) function is implemented in a language monitor server DLL or in a port monitor server DLL.

To send a single request to the printer, an application or printer driver must first compose the request, and then call the IBidiSpl::SendRecv method. To send multiple requests, the application or driver composes a list of requests, and then calls the **IBidiSpl::MultiSendRecv** method.

After receiving the request, the client-side portion of the spooler (Winspool.drv) passes it on to the server-side spooler (spoolsv.exe). The server-side spooler can be on the local computer, or on a remote network print server. When the server-side spooler receives the request, it parses the data in the request, and fills in the members of a [**BIDI\_REQUEST\_CONTAINER**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/winspool/ns-winspool-_bidi_request_container) structure.

The server-side spooler then calls [**SendRecvBidiData**](/previous-versions/ff562068(v=vs.85)) or [**SendRecvBidiDataFromPort**](/previous-versions/ff562071(v=vs.85)). When either function returns, its *ppResData* parameter points to a memory location that contains the address of a filled-in [**BIDI_RESPONSE_CONTAINER**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/winspool/ns-winspool-_bidi_response_container) structure that contains the printer's response. The server-side spooler converts the data in this structure to a form suitable for use by the application or driver, and passes it back to the client-side spooler, and finally back to the originator of the request.
