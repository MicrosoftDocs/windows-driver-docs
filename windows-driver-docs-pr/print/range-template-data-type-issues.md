# Range Template Data Type Issues


The \*ArraySize directive accepts one integer or a range of integers. (A range is two integers separated by a hyphen (-) and optionally enclosed by parenthesis or square brackets \[for example, \*ArraySize: \[1-15\]\]). You can use the GPD wildcard (\*) to represent any integer value. For example, to define an array of any size, you could use \*ArraySize: \*.
