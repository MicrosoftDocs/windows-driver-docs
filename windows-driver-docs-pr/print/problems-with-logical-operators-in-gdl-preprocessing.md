# Problems with Logical Operators in GDL Preprocessing


Logical operators in GDL preprocessor conditionals are not currently supported, but they can be simulated.

### <a href="" id="simulating-the-not-operator"></a> Simulating the NOT operator

You might typically use the NOT operator as the following code example shows.

```cpp
#Ifdef:  symbol
--do this--
#Endif: 
```

However, you should use the following code example instead.

```cpp
#Ifdef:  symbol
#Else:
--do this--
#Endif: 
```

### <a href="" id="simulating-the-and-operator"></a> Simulating the AND operator

You might typically use the AND operator as the following code example shows.

```cpp
#Ifdef:  (symbolA  *AND* symbolB)
--do this--
#Endif: 
```

However, you should use the following code example instead.

```cpp
#Ifdef:  symbolA
#Ifdef:  symbolB
--do this--
#Endif: 
#Endif: 
```

### <a href="" id="simulating-the-or-operator"></a> Simulating the OR operator

You might typically use the OR operator as the following code example shows.

```cpp
#Ifdef:  (symbolA  *OR* symbolB)
--do this--
#Endif: 
```

However, you should use the following code example instead.

```cpp
#Ifdef:  symbolA
#Define: TempSymbol
#Elseifdef: symbolB
#Define: TempSymbol
#Endif: 
#Ifdef:  TempSymbol
--do this--
#Endif: 
#Undefine: TempSymbol
```
