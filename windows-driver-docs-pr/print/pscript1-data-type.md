# PSCRIPT1 Data Type





PSCRIPT1 data is Postscript data that is targeted for printing on a non-Postscript printer. The print processor interprets the Postscript commands and writes the resulting RAW-formatted output to a file.

For more information about the PSCRIPT1 data type, see the *Windows 2000 Professional Resource Kit* or the *Windows 2000 Server Resource Kit*. (These resources may not be available in some languages and countries.)
