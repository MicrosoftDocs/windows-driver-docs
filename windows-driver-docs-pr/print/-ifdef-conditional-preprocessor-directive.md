# \#Ifdef Conditional Preprocessor Directive


```GDL
#Ifdef: symbol
```

The \#Ifdef directive defines the start of a conditional construct and section. The section is preserved if the symbol is found in the preprocessor symbol dictionary. If the symbol is not found, it is deleted. The *symbol* value is required.
