# Print capabilities

[!include[Print Support Apps](../includes/print-support-apps.md)]

By using print capabilities technology, a print driver can return its capabilities as a set of elements in an XML document. Earlier versions of print drivers returned their capabilities information when the application called the **DeviceCapabilities** or **GetDeviceCaps** functions. These Microsoft Win32 functions, however, are limited because they return only information about a fixed set of printer features and settings and can return information about only one feature or setting for each function call.

In contrast, the XML **PrintCapabilities** document is much more flexible and is designed to support new printer features. The **PrintCapabilities** function also returns the entire XML **PrintCapabilities** document in one function call.

This section covers the following aspects of print capabilities:
