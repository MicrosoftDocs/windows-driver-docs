# RemoveRADIUSServer


The **RemoveRADIUSServer** method removes a RADIUS server from the list of RADIUS servers that supervise authentication negotiations between the initiator and its targets.

This WMI method belongs to the unpublished [MSiSCSI\_Operations WMI class](msiscsi-operations-wmi-class.md). For a description of the parameters of the **RemoveRADIUSServer** method, see the member descriptions for the [**RemoveRADIUSServer\_IN**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff564023) and [**RemoveRADIUSServer\_OUT**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff564029) structures.

Miniport drivers that implement the MSiSCSI\_Operations WMI class are not required to support **RemoveRADIUSServer**.
