# Handling WMI SRBs in Storage Miniport Drivers

WMI interfaces that report information about a host bus adapter (HBA), or that allow WMI clients to interact with the HBA's storage miniport driver, usually require the miniport driver to function as a WMI provider. After a storage miniport driver registers as a WMI provider, it must be prepared to handle a special kind of SCSI request block (SRB) called a Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) SCSI request block ([SCSI_WMI_REQUEST_BLOCK](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/srb/ns-srb-_scsi_wmi_request_block)).

To prepare your storage miniport driver to handle WMI SRBs, complete the following steps:

1. Design and compile a Managed Object Format (MOF) file that describes those parts of the WMI schema that are not defined by system-supplied MOF files.

    For a description of MOF syntax, see [MOF Syntax for WMI Data and Event Blocks](../kernel/mof-syntax-for-wmi-data-and-event-blocks.md).

2. Implement miniport driver callback routines.

    The SCSI Port WMI library simplifies the processing of WMI SRBs for miniport drivers. To use the SCSI Port WMI library, implement the *HwScsiWmiXxx* callback routines described in [SCSI Miniport Driver Routines](scsi-miniport-driver-routines.md).

3. Add required code to the miniport driver's [**DriverEntry of SCSI Miniport Driver**](driverentry-of-scsi-miniport-driver.md) routine.

4. Add required code to the miniport driver's [*HwScsiFindAdapter*](/previous-versions/windows/hardware/drivers/ff557300(v=vs.85)) routine.

5. Add required code to the miniport driver's [*HwScsiStartIo*](/previous-versions/windows/hardware/drivers/ff557323(v=vs.85)) routine.
