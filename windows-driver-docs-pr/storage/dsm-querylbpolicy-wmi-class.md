# DSM\_QueryLBPolicy WMI Class


MPIO publishes the DSM\_QUERYLBPolicy\_V2 WMI class but expects the DSM to register the GUID and handle its implementation. A WMI client uses the DSM\_QUERYLBPolicy\_V2 WMI class to query the load balance policy set for an MPIO disk.

```cpp
class DSM_QueryLBPolicy
{

    [key, read]
    string InstanceName;

    [read]
    boolean Active;

    [WmiDataId(1),
     DisplayName("Load Balance Policy") : amended,
     Description("Load Balance Policy that is currently being used by DSM") : amended
    ]
    DSM_Load_Balance_Policy LoadBalancePolicy;
};
```

When this class definition is compiled by the WMI tool suite, it produces the [**DSM\_QueryLBPolicy**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/mpiodisk/ns-mpiodisk-_dsm_querylbpolicy) data structure. There are no methods associated with this WMI class.
