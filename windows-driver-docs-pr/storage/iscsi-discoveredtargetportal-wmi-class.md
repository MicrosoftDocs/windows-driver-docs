# ISCSI\_DiscoveredTargetPortal WMI Class


## <span id="ddk_iscsi_discoveredtargetportal_wmi_class_kr"></span><span id="DDK_ISCSI_DISCOVEREDTARGETPORTAL_WMI_CLASS_KR"></span>


The ISCSI\_DiscoveredTargetPortal WMI class provides information that is associated with a discovered target portal. In addition to the network address of the target portal, this class contains information about the target portal's security characteristics.

ISCSI\_DiscoveredTargetPortal is a superset of the information that is provided by the [ISCSI\_TargetPortal WMI class](iscsi-targetportal-wmi-class.md), which defines only the target portal address.

The ISCSI\_DiscoveredTargetPortal class is unpublished and is defined in *Discover.mof*.

When the WMI tool suite compiles this class definition, it produces the [**ISCSI\_DiscoveredTargetPortal**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff561509) data structure.
