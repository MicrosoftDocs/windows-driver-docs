# HBAFCPScsiEntry WMI Class


## <span id="ddk_hbafcpscsientry_wmi_class_kr"></span><span id="DDK_HBAFCPSCSIENTRY_WMI_CLASS_KR"></span>


An HBA miniport driver that supports the T11 committee's *Fibre Channel HBA API* specification uses the HBAFCPScsiEntry class to store information generated by the operating system that uniquely identifies a SCSI logical unit and its adapter. This class is used to construct a binding between the operating system information and the FCP identifier for the logical unit. For an explanation of this binding, see [**HBAFCPBindingEntry**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff556034). For an explanation of the Fibre Channel protocol, see the T11 committee's *dpANS Fibre Channel Protocol for SCSI* specification.

The HBAFCPScsiEntry class is defined as follows in *Hbaapi.mof*:

```cpp
class HBAFCPScsiEntry {
  [HBAType("HBA_FCPID"), WmiDataId(1)] HBAFCPID  FCPId;
  [HBAType("HBA_LUID"), WmiDataId(2)] uint8  Luid[256];
  [HBAType("HBA_SCSIID"), WmiDataId(3)] HBAScsiID  ScsiId;
};
```

When compiled by the WMI tool suite this class definition produces the following data structure:

There are no methods associated with this WMI class.
