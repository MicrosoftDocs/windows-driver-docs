# MPIO\_DISK\_HEALTH\_INFO WMI Class


An MPIO driver uses the MPIO\_DISK\_HEALTH\_INFO WMI class to report health statistics of all the MPIO disks that it manages.

```cpp
class MPIO_DISK_HEALTH_INFO
{
    [key, read]
     string InstanceName;
    [read] boolean Active;

    [WmiDataId(1),
     read,
     Description("Number of Pseudo-LUN Health Packets.") : amended
    ] uint32 NumberDiskPackets;

    [WmiDataId(2),
     read,
     Description("Reserved for future use.") : amended
    ] uint32 Reserved;

    [WmiDataId(3),
     read,
     Description("MPIO Pseudo-LUN Health Info Array.") : amended,
     WmiSizeIs("NumberDiskPackets")
    ] MPIO_DISK_HEALTH_CLASS DiskHealthPackets[];
};
```

When this class definition is compiled by the WMI tool suite, it produces the [**MPIO\_DISK\_HEALTH\_INFO**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/mpiowmi/ns-mpiowmi-_mpio_disk_health_info) data structure. There are no methods associated with this WMI class.
