# ISCSI\_DiscoveredTargetPortal2 WMI Class


The ISCSI\_DiscoveredTargetPortal2 WMI class provides information that is associated with a discovered target portal. In addition to the network address of the target portal, this class contains information about the target portal's security characteristics.

ISCSI\_DiscoveredTargetPortal2 is similar to the [ISCSI\_DiscoveredTargetPortal WMI class](iscsi-discoveredtargetportal-wmi-class.md), but ISCSI\_DiscoveredTargetPortal2 contains target portal information that the ISCSI\_DiscoveredTargetPortal WMI class does not have, such as the tag number for the portal group.

The ISCSI\_DiscoveredTargetPortal2 WMI class is a superset of the information that is provided by the [ISCSI\_TargetPortal WMI class](iscsi-targetportal-wmi-class.md), which defines only the target portal address.

The ISCSI\_DiscoveredTargetPortal2 WMI class is an unpublished class that is defined in *Discover.mof*.

When the WMI tool suite compiles this class definition, it produces the [**ISCSI\_DiscoveredTargetPortal2**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/iscsifnd/ns-iscsifnd-_iscsi_discoveredtargetportal2) data structure
