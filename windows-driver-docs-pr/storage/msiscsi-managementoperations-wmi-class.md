# MSiSCSI\_ManagementOperations WMI Class


The MSiSCSI\_MangementOperations WMI class contains ping methods to perform ICMP ping requests to the destination addresses. This class is defined as follows in Mgmt.mof.

```cpp
class MSiSCSI_ManagementOperations
{
    //
    // This class must be registered using PDO instance names
    //
    [key]
    string InstanceName;
 
    boolean Active;

    [WmiMethodId(10),
     Implemented,
     Description("Perform an ICMP ping") : amended,
     cpp_quote(
"//\n"
"// This method is recommended.\n"
"//\n"             
"// Ping will perform ICMP ping requests to the destination address \n"
"// and return the number of ping responses received. This is only supported\n"
"// by some HBA, use the ping command for the software initiator.\n"
"//\n"
              )            
    ]
    void PingIPAddress(
                     [in,
                      Description("Number of requests to send") : amended
                     ] uint32 RequestCount,

                     [in,
                      Description("Number of bytes in each request") : amended
                     ] uint32 RequestSize,

                     [in,
                      Description("Number of ms to wait for response") : amended
                     ] uint32 Timeout,

                     [in,
                      description("IP address to ping") : amended
                     ] ISCSI_IP_Address Address,
 
                     [out,
                      ISCSI_STATUS_QUALIFIERS
                     ] ISCSI_STATUS Status,
 
                     [out,
                      Description("Number of responses received") : amended
                     ] uint32 ResponsesReceived

                    );

 
};
```

When the WMI tool suite compiles the preceding class definition, it produces one of the [MSiSCSI\_ManagementOperations](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/index) data structures.
