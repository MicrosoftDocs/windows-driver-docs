# AddTarget function


The **AddTarget** WMI method configures the WMI provider to inform the WMI client about events that are associated with the indicated targets.

## Syntax

```ManagedCPlusPlus
void AddTarget(
   [in, HBAType("HBA_WWN")] uint8          HbaPortWWN[8],
   [in, HBAType("HBA_WWN")] uint8          DiscoveredPortWWN[8],
   [in] uint32                             AllTargets,
   [out, HBA_STATUS_QUALIFIERS] HBA_STATUS HBAStatus
);
```

## Parameters

*HbaPortWWN\[8\]*   
The worldwide name of the local port whose events the WMI client will receive.

*DiscoveredPortWWN\[8\]*   
A worldwide name that specifies the discovered target whose events the WMI client will receive.

*AllTargets*   
The scope of the target events to report. If this member is zero, the WMI client will receive events associated with the port that is indicated by *DiscoveredPortWWN*. If this member is nonzero, the WMI client will receive all events associated with all currently discovered targets as well as targets that are discovered in the future.

*HBAStatus*   
On return, contains the status of the operation. For a list of allowed values and their descriptions, see [HBA\_STATUS](hba-status.md). The miniport driver returns this information in the **HBAStatus** member of a [**AddTarget\_OUT**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/hbapiwmi/ns-hbapiwmi-_addtarget_out) structure.

## Return value

Not applicable to WMI methods.

## Remarks

This WMI method belongs to the [MSFC\_EventControl WMI Class](msfc-eventcontrol-wmi-class.md).
