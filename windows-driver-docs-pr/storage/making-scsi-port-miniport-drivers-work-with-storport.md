# Making SCSI Port Miniport Drivers Work with Storport

The Storport-miniport driver interface is designed to be as similar to the SCSI Port-miniport driver interface as possible, in order to facilitate the adaptation of SCSI Port miniport drivers to work with the Storport driver. In order to make a SCSI Port miniport driver work with Storport, you must take the following basic steps:

1.  Change all instances of the **\#include** &lt;*scsi.h*&gt; directive with the **\#include** &lt;*storport.h*&gt; directive.

    If both the *scsi.h* and *storport.h* header files are included, a compile time error will occur.

2.  Replace s*csiport.lib* with *storport.lib* in your build scripts, that is, in the sources or **makefile** file.

3.  Make certain that all expanded structures are properly initialized.

    The sizes of both the [**HW\_INITIALIZATION\_DATA (SCSI)**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/srb/ns-srb-_hw_initialization_data) structure and the [**PORT\_CONFIGURATION\_INFORMATION (SCSI)**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/srb/ns-srb-_port_configuration_information) structure have changed, so make certain the new members are properly initialized.

The Storport header file, *storport.h,* currently retains both SCSI Port-prefixed commands and StorPort-prefixed commands to facilitate porting from the SCSI Port.

This section provides more detailed instructions for driver writers who wish to modify a miniport driver that is designed to work with SCSI Port, so that it can work with Storport. The following topics are covered:
