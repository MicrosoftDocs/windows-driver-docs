# GetSupportedGroupCopyStates method of the MSFT\_ReplicationCapabilities class

Returns, for a given *ReplicationType*, the supported replication group copy states.

## Syntax


```mof
UInt32 GetSupportedGroupCopyStates(
  [in]  UInt16 ReplicationType,
  [out] UInt16 SupportedCopyStates[],
  [out] String ExtendedStatus
);
```



## Parameters

 

*ReplicationType* \[in\]
 

A value representing the replication type. This must be in the enumeration [**MSFT\_ReplicationCapabilities**](msft-replicationcapabilities.md).SupportedReplicationTypes.

 

*SupportedCopyStates* \[out\]
 

The supported copy states. One of the following values.



| Value                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                 |

|  **Initialized** 2                               | The link to enable replication is established, and the source and target have been associated. However, the copy operation has not started.                                  |
|  **Unsynchronized** 3                   | Not all of the source data has been copied to the target.                                                                                                                    |
|  **Synchronized** 4                           | All of the source data has been copied to the target.                                                                                                                        |
|  **Broken** 5                                                   | The relationship is nonfunctional due to errors in the source, the target, the path between the two, or space constraints.                                                   |
|  **Fractured** 6                                       | The target is split from the source.                                                                                                                                         |
|  **Split** 7                                                       | The target was gracefully (or systematically) split from the source in a way that ensures consistency.                                                                       |
|  **Inactive** 8                                           | The copy operation has stopped. Writes to the source will not be sent to the target.                                                                                         |
|  **Suspended** 9                                       | Data flow between the source and target has stopped. Writes to the source are held until the association is resumed.                                                         |
|  **Failedover** 10                                  | Reads from and writes to the target have failed. The source is not reachable.                                                                                                |
|  **Prepared** 11                                          | Initialization is completed, and the copy operation has started. However, the data flow has not started.                                                                     |
|  **Aborted** 12                                              | The copy operation was aborted. Use the Resync Replica operation to restart the copy operation.                                                                              |
|  **Skewed** 13                                                  | The target has been modified and is no longer synchronized with the source or the point-in-time view.                                                                        |
|  **Mixed** 14                                                      | Applies to the *CopyState* of *GroupSynchronized*. It indicates that the *StorageSynchronized* associations of the elements in the groups have different *CopyState* values. |
|  **Not Applicable** 15                  | The target does not have a replication state.                                                                                                                                |
|  **Microsoft Reserved** ..  | This value is reserved for system use.                                                                                                                                       |
