# Introduction to Changer Drivers

A changer driver controls the elements of a media library, or *changer* (sometimes called an *autoloader*, *autochanger*, or *jukebox*). In NT-based operating systems, a driver for a changer consists of the following:

- A system-supplied changer class driver provided as a library, *mcd.lib*, that provides functionality common to all changer drivers

- A device-specific miniclass driver, statically linked to *mcd.lib*, that provides routines called by the changer class driver to support a particular type of changer

This section describes the Windows changer driver model, and provides details for writing a new changer miniclass driver.
