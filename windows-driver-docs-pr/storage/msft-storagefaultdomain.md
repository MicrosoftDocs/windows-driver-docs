# MSFT\_StorageFaultDomain class

Common base class for all storage fault domain objects.

The following syntax is simplified from MOF code and includes all inherited properties.

## Syntax

``` syntax
class MSFT_StorageFaultDomain : MSFT_StorageObject
{
  String Manufacturer;
  String Model;
  String SerialNumber;
  String PhysicalLocation;
  UInt16 HealthStatus;
  UInt16 OperationalStatus[];
};
```

### Properties

The **MSFT\_StorageFaultDomain** class has these properties.

 

**HealthStatus**
   

Data type: **UInt16**
 

Access type: Read-only

|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  **Healthy** 0          | The object is in a good state. There has been no reported read or write packet loss.          |
|  **Warning** 1          | The object may be failing some read requests, but there have been no reported write failures. |
|  **Unhealthy** 2  | The object is failing read and write requests, or is no longer responding to any commands.    |
|  **Unknown** 5          | The health status is unknown.                                                                 |



 

 

**Manufacturer**
   

Data type: **String**
 

Access type: Read-only

**Model**
   

Data type: **String**
 

Access type: Read-only
 

Represents the model number of the hardware. For [**MSFT\_PhysicalDisk**](msft-physicaldisk.md) it must match the disk's SCSI inquiry data.

 

**OperationalStatus**
   

Data type: **UInt16** array
 

Access type: Read-only
 

An array of values that specify the operational status of the object.
