# SCSI Miniport Driver's HwScsiEnableInterruptsCallback Routine

A [*HwScsiEnableInterruptsCallback*](/previous-versions/windows/hardware/drivers/ff557295(v=vs.85)) routine finishes processing an interrupt-driven I/O operation without inhibiting I/O operations for other devices in the machine.

When the *HwScsiEnableInterruptsCallback* routine gets control, all system device interrupts are enabled except from the HBA because the *HwScsiInterrupt* routine disabled interrupts on the HBA before it called [**ScsiPortNotification**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/srb/nf-srb-scsiportnotification). Thus, the miniport driver's *HwScsiInterrupt* routine cannot be called and cannot disturb the context data it set up about the current operation while the *HwScsiEnableInterruptsCallback* routine is running.

A *HwScsiEnableInterruptsCallback* routine should do the following:

1. Use the context that was set up for the operation in the input device extension to complete processing of the request that caused the interrupt.

2. Call **ScsiPortNotification** with the *NotificationType***RequestComplete** and the just-satisfied SRB.

3. Call **ScsiPortNotification** with the *NotificationType***NextRequest**, or with **NextLuRequest** if the HBA supports tagged queuing or multiple requests per logical unit.

4. Call **ScsiPortNotification** with a pointer to the device extension, the *NotificationType***CallDisableInterrupts**, and the miniport driver's *HwScsiDisableInterruptsCallback* routine, described in [SCSI Miniport Driver's HwScsiDisableInterruptsCallback Routine](scsi-miniport-driver-s-hwscsidisableinterruptscallback-routine.md).

5. Return control.

The NT-based operating system **ScsiPortNotification** routine calls the *HwScsiDisableInterruptsCallback* routine with a subset of the system device interrupts disabled. No device interrupt with a system-assigned hardware priority (IRQL) less than or equal to the HBA's can occur.

See [Managing Hardware Priorities](../kernel/managing-hardware-priorities.md
) for more information.
