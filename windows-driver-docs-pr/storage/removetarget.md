# RemoveTarget function


The **RemoveTarget** WMI method configures the WMI provider so that it stops passing events associated with the indicated target to the WMI client.

## Syntax

```ManagedCPlusPlus
void RemoveTarget(
   [in, HBAType("HBA_WWN")] uint8          HbaPortWWN[8],
   [in, HBAType("HBA_WWN")] uint8          DiscoveredPortWWN[8],
   [in] uint32                             AllTargets,
   [out, HBA_STATUS_QUALIFIERS] HBA_STATUS HBAStatus
);
```

## Parameters

*HbaPortWWN*   
A 64 bit worldwide name (WWN) that uniquely identifies the local port that should be removed from the list of ports whose events are reported to the WMI client. For a discussion of worldwide names, see the T11 committee's *Fibre Channel HBA API* specification.

*DiscoveredPortWWN*   
A WWN that indicates the remote discovered port that should be removed from the list of ports whose events are reported to the WMI client.

*AllTargets*   
The events to stop reporting. If this member is zero, the WMI provider client will stop reporting events associated with the port that is indicated by *DiscoveredPortWWN*. If this member is nonzero, the WMI provider will cease reporting all events associated any target.

*HBAStatus*   
On return, contains the status of the operation. For a list of allowed values and their descriptions, see [HBA\_STATUS](hba-status.md). The miniport driver returns this information in the **HBAStatus** member of a [**RemoveTarget\_OUT**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/hbapiwmi/ns-hbapiwmi-_removetarget_out) structure.

## Return value

Not applicable to WMI methods.

## Remarks

This WMI method belongs to the [MSFC\_EventControl WMI Class](msfc-eventcontrol-wmi-class.md).
