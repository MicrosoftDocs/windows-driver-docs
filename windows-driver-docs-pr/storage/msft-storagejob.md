# MSFT\_StorageJob class

Represents a storage job.

The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code.

Storage jobs represent long running operations on a storage subsystem. These operations can be initiated in either of the following ways:

-   By users, through the various management interfaces defined by this MOF.
-   Automatically, by intelligent storage subsystems.

## Syntax

``` syntax

|:-----------------------------------------------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [**GetExtendedStatus**](msft-storagejob-getextendedstatus.md)   | Retrieves extended status information for an unsuccessful storage job.                                  |
| [**RequestStateChange**](msft-storagejob-requeststatechange.md) | Requests that the state of the job be changed to the value specified in the *RequestedState* parameter. |



 

### Properties

The **MSFT\_StorageJob** class has these properties.

 

**DeleteOnCompletion**
   

Data type: **Boolean**
 

Access type: Read-only
 

If **TRUE**, the storage job will be deleted automatically after a short time interval.

 

**Description**
   

Data type: **String**
 

Access type: Read-only
 

A textual description of the operation that the storage job is tracking.

 

**ElapsedTime**
   

Data type: **Datetime**
 

Access type: Read-only
 

If the job is still executing, this property indicates how long it has been executing. If the job is complete, it is the total execution time.

 

**ErrorCode**
   

Data type: **UInt16**
 

Access type: Read-only
 

If the operation that this storage job was tracking has failed, the provider sets this property to an error code defined by the method that invoked the operation. If this storage job was tracking a background task, the error code can be set to any valid storage management error code as defined in the value map below. If there was no error, this property must be set to **Success**. This property should be **NULL** until the operation has completed.

 

**ErrorDescription**

Access type: Read-only
 

A free-form string that contains the vendor's error description.

 

**IsBackgroundTask**
   

Data type: **Boolean**
 

Access type: Read-only
 

Qualifiers: [**Required**](/windows/win32/wmisdk/standard-qualifiers)
 

If **TRUE**, this storage job represents an automated background task initiated by the storage subsystem. For all user- or management-initiated operations, this value should be set to **FALSE**.

 

**JobState**
   

Data type: **UInt16**
 

Access type: Read-only
 

Qualifiers: [**Required**](/windows/win32/wmisdk/standard-qualifiers)

**JobStatus**
   

Data type: **String**
 

Access type: Read-only
 

A free-form string that represents the status of the job. The primary status is reflected in the **OperationalStatus** property. **JobStatus** provides additional, implementation-specific details.

 

**LocalOrUtcTime**
   

Data type: **UInt16**
 

Access type: Read-only
 

Qualifiers: **Values** ( "Local Time", "UTC Time" ), **ValueMap** ("1", "2")
 

Indicates whether the time values in the **RunStartInterval** and **UntilTime** properties represent local time or UTC time. Time values are synchronized worldwide by setting this property to **UTC Time**.

 

**Name**

**StartTime**
   

Data type: **Datetime**
 

Access type: Read-only
 

The time when the job was started.

 

**StatusDescriptions**
   

Data type: **String** array
 

Access type: Read-only
 

Descriptions of the **OperationalStatus** values. For example, if **Stopping** is a value in **OperationalStatus**, the corresponding array element of **StatusDescriptions** may explain why an object is being stopped.

 

**TimeBeforeRemoval**
   

Data type: **Datetime**
 

Access type: Read-only
 

The amount of time, in seconds, that the job is retained after it has finished executing, either succeeding or failing in that execution. The job must remain in existence for some period of time regardless of the value of the **DeleteOnCompletion** property.

 

**TimeOfLastStateChange**
   

Data type: **Datetime**
 

Access type: Read-only
 

The time when the state of the job last changed. If the state of the job has not changed and this property does not have a value, it must be set to zero. If a state change was requested, but it was rejected or has not yet been processed, the value of this property must not be updated.

 

**TimeSubmitted**
