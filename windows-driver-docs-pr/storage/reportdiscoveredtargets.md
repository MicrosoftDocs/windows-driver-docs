# ReportDiscoveredTargets


The **ReportDiscoveredTargets** WMI method reports all discovered targets.

This WMI method belongs to the unpublished [MSiSCSI\_DiscoveryOperations WMI class](msiscsi-discoveryoperations-wmi-class.md) that is defined in *Discover.mof*. For a description of the parameters of the **ReportDiscoveredTargets** method, see the member descriptions for the [**ReportDiscoveredTargets\_OUT**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff564058) structure.

Miniport drivers that implement the MSiSCSI\_DiscoveryOperations WMI class must support **ReportDiscoveredTargets**.
