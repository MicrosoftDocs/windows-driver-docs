# SM\_SendRLS function


The SM\_SendRLS WMI method sends a read link status (RLS) through the indicated local port. This RLS is sent to the indicated remote port to retrieve a link error status block that is associated with the remote port.

## Syntax

```ManagedCPlusPlus
void SM_SendRLS(
   [in, HBAType("HBA_WWN")] uint8              HbaPortWWN[8],
   [in, HBAType("HBA_WWN")] uint8              DestWWN[8],
   [in] uint32                                 InRespBufferMaxSize,
   [out, HBA_STATUS_QUALIFIERS] HBA_STATUS     HBAStatus,
   [out] uint32                                TotalRespBufferSize,
   [out] uint32                                OutRespBufferSize,
   [out, WmiSizeIs("OutRespBufferSize")] uint8 RespBuffer[]
);
```

## Parameters

*HbaPortWWN*   
A worldwide name (WWN) for the local port through which the RLS command is sent. This information is delivered to the miniport driver in the HbaPortWWN member of a SM\_SendRLS\_IN structure.

*DestWWN*   
A worldwide name (WWN) for the destination port. This information is delivered to the miniport driver in the DestWWN member of a SM\_SendRLS\_IN structure.

*InRespBufferMaxSize*   
The maximum size, in bytes, of the response buffer.

*HBAStatus*   
The status of the operation. For a list of allowed values and their descriptions, see [HBA\_STATUS](hba-status.md). The miniport driver returns this information in the HBAStatus member of a SM\_SendRLS\_OUT structure.

*TotalRespBufferSize*   
The size, in bytes, of the results of the RLS command. The miniport driver returns this information in the TotalRespBufferSize member of a SM\_SendRLS\_OUT structure.

*OutRespBufferSize*   
The size, in bytes, of the data that was actually retrieved. The miniport driver returns this information in the OutRespBufferSize member of a SM\_SendRLS\_OUT structure.

*RespBuffer*   
The results of the RLS command. The miniport driver returns this information in the RespBuffer member of a SM\_SendRLS\_OUT structure.

## Return value

Not applicable to WMI methods.

## Remarks

This WMI method belongs to the MS\_SM\_FabricAndDomainManagementMethods WMI Class.
