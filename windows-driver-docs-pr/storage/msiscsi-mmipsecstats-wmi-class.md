# MSiSCSI\_MMIPSECStats WMI Class


## <span id="ddk_msiscsi_mmipsecstats_wmi_class_kr"></span><span id="DDK_MSISCSI_MMIPSECSTATS_WMI_CLASS_KR"></span>


The MSiSCSI\_MMIPSECStats WMI class exposes the main mode IPsec statistics.

Because this class is associated with a particular instance of a storage miniport driver, the miniport driver must register the class using the name of the particular physical device object (PDO) that the miniport driver manages.

The MSiSCSI\_MMIPSECStats class is defined in *Iscsiprf.mof*.
