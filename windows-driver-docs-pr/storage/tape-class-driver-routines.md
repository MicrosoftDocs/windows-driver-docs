# Tape Class Driver Routines

The system-supplied tape class driver handles generic tape operations and provides operating system-specific support to individual tape miniclass drivers.

These routines are defined in *minitape.h*. See [minitape.h header](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/minitape/) for a list of tape class driver routines.

For a list of tape miniport driver routines, see [Tape Miniclass Driver Routines](tape-miniclass-driver-routines.md).
