# MSFC\_EventControl WMI Class


## <span id="ddk_msfc_eventcontrol_wmi_class_kr"></span><span id="DDK_MSFC_EVENTCONTROL_WMI_CLASS_KR"></span>


The MSFC\_EventControl class defines WMI methods that allow WMI clients to control the delivery of link, port and target events.

This WMI class has no data blocks, and therefore the WMI tool suite generates declarations for structures that hold parameter data for the methods that belong to the class, but it does not generate a structure declaration corresponding to the class itself.

The MOF syntax for each method that belongs to this class is described in the reference page for the method. The following reference pages describe these methods and their accompanying structures:

[**AddLink**](addlink.md)

[**AddPort**](addport.md)

[**AddTarget**](addtarget.md)

[**RemoveLink**](removelink.md)

[**RemovePort**](removeport.md)

[**RemoveTarget**](removetarget.md)
