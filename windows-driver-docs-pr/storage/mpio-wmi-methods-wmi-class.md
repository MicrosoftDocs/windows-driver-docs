# MPIO\_WMI\_METHODS WMI Class


An MPIO driver uses the MPIO\_WMI\_METHODS WMI class to provide various services to a WMI client.

This WMI class has no data blocks. Therefore, the WMI tool suite generates structures that hold parameter data for the methods that belong to this class, but it does not generate a structure that corresponds to the class itself.

The MOF file syntax for each method that belongs to this class is described in the reference page for the method. The following sections describe these methods and their accompanying structures:

[**MPIOMoveDevice**](mpiomovedevice.md)

[**GetPathConfiguration**](getpathconfiguration.md)

[**SetDSMCounters**](setdsmcounters.md)

[**ClearPathHealthCounters**](clearpathhealthcounters.md)

[**ClearMpioDiskHealthCounters**](clearmpiodiskhealthcounters.md)

[**ClearAllPathHealthCounters**](clearallpathhealthcounters.md)

[**ClearAllMpioDiskHealthCounters**](clearallmpiodiskhealthcounters.md)
