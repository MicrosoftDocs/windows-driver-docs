# StorNVMe SCSI Translation Support

The following table lists SCSI commands and the translated NVMe command(s), where applicable. **StorNVMe** on Windows 10 version 1903 and later versions is compliant to SCSI Translation Reference Rev 1.5.

For more information, see [Working with NVMe drives](/windows/win32/fileio/working-with-nvme-devices#protocol-specific-queries).
