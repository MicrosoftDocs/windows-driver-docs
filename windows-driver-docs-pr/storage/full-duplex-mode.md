# Full-Duplex Mode


## <span id="ddk_full_duplex_mode_kg"></span><span id="DDK_FULL_DUPLEX_MODE_KG"></span>


The Storport driver supports an I/O model tailored specifically for high-performance buses. This I/O model allows miniport drivers to operate in full-duplex mode, which means that a miniport driver can add new requests to its queue even while it is in the process of completing others. Moreover, in full-duplex mode, the miniport driver does not have to synchronize the execution of its [**StartIo**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nc-wdm-driver_startio) and interrupt service routines. This can lead to significant performance enhancements. However, miniport drivers must be designed to take advantage of full-duplex mode, because Storport operates in half-duplex mode by default.

A miniport driver must configure Storport to operate in full-duplex mode while executing its [**HwStorFindAdapter**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/storport/nc-storport-hw_find_adapter) routine. It does this by initializing the **SynchronizationModel** member of the miniport driver's [**PORT\_CONFIGURATION\_INFORMATION (STORPORT)**](/previous-versions/windows/hardware/drivers/ff563901(v=vs.85)) structure to **StorSynchronizeFullDuplex**.
