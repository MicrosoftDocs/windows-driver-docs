# SM\_GetBindingSupport function


The SM\_GetBindingSupport method retrieves the binding capabilities that are currently enabled for the indicated port.

## Syntax

```ManagedCPlusPlus
void SM_GetBindingSupport(
   [in, HBAType("HBA_WWN")] uint8                 HbaPortWWN[8],
   [in, HBAType("HBA_WWN")] uint8                 DomainPortWWN[8],
   [out, HBA_STATUS_QUALIFIERS] HBA_STATUS        HBAStatus,
   [out, HBAType("SMHBA_BIND_CAPABILITY")] uint32 Flags
);
```

## Parameters

*HbaPortWWN*   
A worldwide name (WWN) for the port whose persistent bindings will be retrieved.

*DomainPortWWN*   
The worldwide name (WWN) for the callback. It is the Port\_Identifier that has the smallest value of any Port\_Identifier of an SMP port that was discovered by using the physical fibre channel port. It has a value of zero if no SMP port has been discovered by using the physical fibre channel port.

*HBAStatus*   
The status of the operation. For a list of allowed values and their descriptions, see the [HBA\_STATUS](hba-status.md) structure. The miniport driver returns this information in the HBAStatus member of a GetBindingSupport\_OUT structure.

*Flags*   
A bitmap that indicates the ability of an HBA and its miniport driver to provide a specific set of features that are related to persistent binding. For a list of values that this parameter can have, see the description of the HBA\_BIND\_TYPE WMI class qualifier.

## Return value

Not applicable to WMI methods.

## Remarks

This WMI method belongs to the MS\_SM\_TargetInformationMethods WMI Class.
