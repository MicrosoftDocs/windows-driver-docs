# StorNVMe command set support

The tables below list commands and opcodes defined in the NVM Express specifications for the NVMe Admin Command Set and all I/O Commands (Base Specification), I/O Commands for the NVM Command Set, and I/O Commands for the Zoned Namespace Command Set.  The tables include the following information:

* *Header Definition* – Indicates that an enumeration for the command is defined in the relevant Windows header file.
* *StorNVMe Supported* – Indicates that the command is supported by the StorNVMe device driver on Windows 10 version 1903 and later.
* *Driver Int Use* (Driver Internal Use) – Indicates that the StorNVMe driver can internally generate/issue the command.
* *Comments* – Any additional relevant information; for example, whether the command can be issued as part of an IOCTL operation. "WinPE Only" indicates that the command is supported only on WinPE editions of Windows.
