# HBAFCPBindingEntry2 WMI Class

An HBA miniport driver that supports the T11 committee's *Fibre Channel HBA API* specification uses the HBAFCPBindingEntry2 class to define a binding between the information that the operating system uses to identify a logical unit on a SCSI device and the Fibre Channel protocol (FCP) identifier for the logical unit. For an explanation of the FCP, see the T11 committee's *dpANS Fibre Channel Protocol for SCSI* specification. For an explanation of this binding between SCSI and FCP identifiers, see the T11 committee's *Fibre Channel HBA API* specification.

The HBAFCPBindingEntry2 class is defined as follows in *Hbaapi.mof*:

```cpp
class HBAFCPBindingEntry2 {
  [WmiDataId(1), HBA_BIND_TYPE_QUALIFIERS] HBA_BIND_TYPE  Type;
  [HBAType("HBA_FCPSCSIENTRY"), WmiDataId(4)] HBAScsiID  ScsiId;
  [HBAType("HBA_FCID"), WmiDataId(2)] HBAFCPID  FCPId;
  [HBAType("HBA_LUID"), WmiDataId(3)] uint8  Luid[256];
};
```

When compiled by the WMI tool suite this class definition produces the following data structure:

[**HBAFCPBindingEntry2**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/hbapiwmi/ns-hbapiwmi-_hbafcpbindingentry2)

There are no methods associated with this WMI class.
