# MPIO WMI Classes


The MPIO WMI classes that are defined in *Mpiowmi.mof*, *Mpiopdow.mof,* and *Mpiolbpo.mof* allow applications to understand the topology of the storage network. They also expose some classes to control certain DSM timers that affect different areas of functionality, as described in the following examples:

-   The amount of time to retain a LUN's device object even after it has lost all its paths.

-   The number of times a failed I/O should be retried before it is sent back to the application.

-   Whether regular path verification needs to be performed by MPIO.

The following topics describe the classes that make up the MPIO WMI interface:
