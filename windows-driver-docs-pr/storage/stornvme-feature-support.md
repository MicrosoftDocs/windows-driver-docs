# NVMe feature and extended capability support

The following table lists Features and Extended Capabilities defined in the NVM Express specifications for NVMe devices as follows:

* The columns with specification references indicate the section(s) in the NVM Express specification that describe the Feature or Extended Capability ("Caps"):
  * *NVMe 1.4 (Features)* – NVM Express Revision 1.4, June 10, 2019
  * *NVMe 2.0 (Caps) Base* – NVM Express Base Specification 2.0a, July 23, 2021
  * *NVMe 2.0 (Caps) NVM* – NVM Express NVM Command Set Specification 1.0a, July 23, 2021
  * *NVMe 2.0 (Caps) ZNS* – Zoned Namespace Command Set Specification 1.1a, July 23, 2021
* StorNVMe Supported – Indicates support in the StorNVMe device driver on Windows 10 version 1903 and later.
* Comments – Any extra relevant information; for example, whether supported as part of an IOCTL operation. "WinPE Only" indicates support only in WinPE editions of Windows.
