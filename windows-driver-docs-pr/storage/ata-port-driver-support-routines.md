# ATA port driver support routines

This page categorizes the support routines provided by the system-supplied ATA port driver.

For a list of ATA driver miniport routines, see [ATA Miniport Drivers](ata-miniport-drivers.md).

## Initialization Routine

ATA port driver provides the following initialization routine.

| Routine | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |

## Callback Routines

The miniport driver uses several routines to request a callback from the port driver.

## Routines that Report a Configuration Change

The following routines enable the miniport driver to notify the ATA port driver of changes to the configuration of the devices that are attached to the channel.

| Routine | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| **AtaPortBusChangeDetected** | Notifies the port driver of changes in the device configuration on the indicated channel. |
| **AtaPortRequestPowerStateChange** | Requests a power state transition for the indicated device. |

## Routines to Control Request Queues

The port driver maintains one per logical unit number (LUN) request queue and one request queue for each channel. The miniport driver can use the following routines to pause and resume the different request queues.

| Routine | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| **AtaPortDeviceBusy** | Informs the port driver that the indicated device is busy. |
| **AtaPortDeviceReady** | Informs the port driver that the indicated device is ready to accept new requests. |

## Utility Routines

The following routines are general utility support functions for miniport drivers.

| Routine | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| **AtaPortCopyMemory** | Copies data from one location to another. |
| **AtaPortMoveMemory routine | Copies data from one location to another. |
| **AtaPortConvertUlongToPhysicalAddress** | Converts a given ULONG address into a value of type IDE_PHYSICAL_ADDRESS. |
| **AtaPortConvertPhysicalAddressToUlong** | Truncates an address of type IDE_PHYSICAL_ADDRESS to a ULONG. |
| **AtaPortStallExecution** | Stalls in the miniport driver. |
| **AtaPortInitializeQueueTag** | Initializes the queue tag list for the specified device. |
| **AtaPortAllocateQueueTag** | Returns a queue tag for the specified device. |
| **AtaPortReleaseQueueTag** | Releases the specified queue tag. |

## Debug and Error Reporting Routines

The following routine can be used for debug and error reporting.

| Routine | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| **AtaPortDebugPrint** | Passes a message string to the kernel debugger for the debugger to print. |

## Routines for Device Port and Register Access
