# DeleteObject method of the MSFT\_VirtualDisk class

Deletes the virtual disk.

After this method is called, the space that was used by the virtual disk is reclaimed and the user cannot reverse the delete operation.

## Syntax


```mof
UInt32 DeleteObject(
  [in]  Boolean             RunAsJob,
  [out] MSFT_StorageJob REF CreatedStorageJob,
  [out] String              ExtendedStatus
);
```



## Parameters

 

*RunAsJob* \[in\]
 

If **TRUE**, this method uses the *CreatedStorageJob* parameter when the request is taking a long time to service. If a storage job has been created to track the operation, this method will return **Method Parameters Checked - Job Started**.

> [!Note]  
> Even if *RunAsJob* is **TRUE**, this method can still return a result if it has finished in sufficient time.

 

If **FALSE** or **NULL**, this method will follow default WMI asynchronous behavior as determined by the client's method for invocation. In other words, it is synchronous unless requested otherwise.

 

*CreatedStorageJob* \[out\]
 

If *RunAsJob* is set to **TRUE** and this method takes a long time to execute, this parameter receives a reference to the storage job object that is used to track the long-running operation.

 

*ExtendedStatus* \[out\]
 

A string that contains an embedded [**MSFT\_StorageExtendedStatus**](msft-storageextendedstatus.md) object.

This parameter allows the storage provider to return extended (implementation-specific) error information.

 

## Return value

 

**Success** (0)
 

**Not Supported** (1)
 

**Unspecified Error** (2)
 

**Timeout** (3)
 

**Failed** (4)
 

**Invalid Parameter** (5)
 

**Method Parameters Checked - Job Started** (4096)
 

**Access denied** (40001)
 

**There are not enough resources to complete the operation.** (40002)
 

**Cache out of date** (40003)
 

**Cannot connect to the storage provider.** (46000)
 

**The storage provider cannot connect to the storage subsystem.** (46001)
 

**The storage pool could not complete the operation because its health or operational status does not permit it.** (48006)
 

**The storage pool could not complete the operation because its configuration is read-only.** (48007)
 

**The virtual disk could not complete the operation because another computer controls its configuration.** (50002)
