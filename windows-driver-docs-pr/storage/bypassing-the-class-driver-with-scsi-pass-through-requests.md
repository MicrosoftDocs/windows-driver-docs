In most cases, a class driver mediates all communication between SCSI Port and higher-level drivers and applications. Some target devices, however, do not have a class driver. Drivers for such devices must communicate directly with SCSI Port by using a class of requests called "pass-through" requests. To use a pass-through request, the higher-level component is required to set up the CDB that is used in the request, rather than relying on the class driver to do so.

A SCSI pass-through request consists of an IRP of type IRP\_MJ\_DEVICE\_CONTROL with a IOCTL code of [**IOCTL\_SCSI\_PASS\_THROUGH**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ntddscsi/ni-ntddscsi-ioctl_scsi_pass_through) or [**IOCTL\_SCSI\_PASS\_THROUGH\_DIRECT**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ntddscsi/ni-ntddscsi-ioctl_scsi_pass_through_direct). If the request passes through a class driver, the class driver is obligated to set the IRP's **MinorFunction** code to IRP\_MJ\_DEVICE\_CONTROL. SCSI Port checks this value to determine whether a pass-through request bypassed the class driver. It is an application error to send a pass-through request directly to SCSI Port if the target device has been claimed by a storage class driver.

SCSI Port does not check the validity of the SCSI command that is embedded in a pass-through request.

For a discussion of SCSI pass-through requests from the perspective of a storage class driver, see [Handling SCSI Pass-Through Requests](handling-scsi-pass-through-requests.md)
