# About Storage Drivers and Device Objects

The storage device stack consists of a tree of device objects created by the drivers that are involved in handling I/O to storage devices on the system. The root of this tree is a functional device object (FDO) for a storage adapter or for another driver stack integrated with the storage stack. The leaves of this tree are device objects for use by file systems and user-mode applications.

Like any PnP driver, a storage class or storage filter driver adds itself to the tree in its AddDevice routine by creating a device object with **IoCreateDevice** and attaching it to the device stack with **IoAttachDeviceToDeviceStack**, using the pointer to the device object passed to the driver's AddDevice routine by the PnP manager at initialization. **IoAttachDeviceToDeviceStack** attaches the new device object to the current top of the device stack.

A tape miniclass, medium changer miniclass, or SCSI miniport driver is not required to create a device object and attach it to the device stack. Instead, the system-supplied tape class, changer class, or SCSI port driver handles these tasks on behalf of the miniclass/miniport, calling miniclass/miniport driver routines to gather the data needed to create the device object.

Storage port drivers create physical device objects (PDOs) of type FILE_DEVICE_MASS_STORAGE. The disk class, CD-ROM class, tape class and changer class drivers create FDOs of types FILE_DEVICE_DISK, FILE_DEVICE_CD_ROM, FILE_DEVICE_TAPE, and FILE_DEVICE_CHANGER respectively.

For information about designing PnP drivers, see the [PnP Driver Design Guidelines](../kernel/pnp-driver-design-guidelines.md). For information about PnP-related **Io***Xxx* routines, see the [Plug and Play Routines](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/index).
