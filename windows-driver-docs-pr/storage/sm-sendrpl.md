# SM\_SendRPL function


The SM\_SendRPL WMI method sends a read port list (RPL) command through the indicated port to indicated destination port.

## Syntax

```ManagedCPlusPlus
void SM_SendRPL(
   [in, HBAType("HBA_WWN")] uint8              PortWWN[8],
   [in, HBAType("HBA_WWN")] uint8              AgentWWN[8],
   [in] uint32                                 AgentDomain,
   [in] uint32                                 PortIndex,
   [in] uint32                                 InRespBufferMaxSize,
   [out, HBA_STATUS_QUALIFIERS] HBA_STATUS     HBAStatus,
   [out] uint32                                TotalRespBufferSize,
   [out] uint32                                OutRespBufferSize,
   [out, WmiSizeIs("OutRespBufferSize")] uint8 RespBuffer[]
);
```

## Parameters

*PortWWN*   
A worldwide name (WWN) for the local port through which the read port list (RPL) command is sent. This information is delivered to the miniport driver in the PortWWN member of a SM\_SendRPL\_IN structure.

*AgentWWN*   
A worldwide name (WWN) for the port that is to be queried for a list of ports of type FC\_Port. For a definition of FC\_Port, see the T11 committee's *Fibre Channel HBA API* specification. This information is delivered to the miniport driver in the AgentWWN member of a SM\_SendRPL\_IN structure.

*AgentDomain*   
The domain number for the domain controller that is to be queried for a list of ports of type FC\_Port. For a definition of FC\_Port, see the T11 committee's *Fibre Channel HBA API* specification. This information is delivered to the miniport driver in the agent\_domain member of a SM\_SendRPL\_IN structure.

*PortIndex*   
The port index of the first port in the list of ports of type FC\_Port to be returned. This information is delivered to the miniport driver in the portIndex member of a SM\_SendRPL\_IN structure.

*InRespBufferMaxSize*   
The maximum size of the response buffer.

*HBAStatus*   
The status of the operation. For a list of allowed values and their descriptions, see [HBA\_STATUS](hba-status.md). The miniport driver returns this information in the HBAStatus member of a SendRPL\_OUT structure.

*TotalRespBufferSize*   
The size, in bytes, of the results of the read port list (RPL) command. The miniport driver returns this information in the TotalRespBufferSize member of a SM\_SendRPL\_OUT structure.

*OutRespBufferSize*   
The size, in bytes, of the data that was actually retrieved. The miniport driver returns this information in the OutRespBufferSize member of a SM\_SendRPL\_OUT structure.

*RespBuffer*   
The results of the read port list (RPL) command. The miniport driver returns this information in the RespBuffer member of a SendRPL\_OUT structure.

## Return value

Not applicable to WMI methods.

## Remarks

This WMI method belongs to the MS\_SM\_FabricAndDomainManagementMethods WMI Class.
