# Storage Class Driver's AddDevice Routine


## <span id="ddk_storage_class_drivers_adddevice_routine_kg"></span><span id="DDK_STORAGE_CLASS_DRIVERS_ADDDEVICE_ROUTINE_KG"></span>


The PnP manager calls a storage class driver's [**AddDevice**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nc-wdm-driver_add_device) routine when it detects a device controlled by that driver. A storage class driver's *AddDevice* routine:

-   Claims the device as described in [Storage Class Driver's ClaimDevice Routine](storage-class-driver-s-claimdevice-routine.md), or, if the driver is unable to claim the device, returns STATUS\_SUCCESS.

-   If the driver successfully claims the device, creates a device object (FDO).

-   Registers device interfaces that applications and other system devices can use. The class driver enables such interfaces when it receives a PnP start request.

-   Prepares the device object to handle a start request as described in [Writing an AddDevice Routine](../kernel/writing-an-adddevice-routine.md).

-   Attaches the device object to the device stack by calling [**IoAttachDeviceToDeviceStack**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-ioattachdevicetodevicestack) with the input PDO.

-   If the device starts in a known power state, calls [**PoSetPowerState**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ntifs/nf-ntifs-posetpowerstate).

-   Clears the DO\_DEVICE\_INITIALIZING flag on the new device object.

A storage class driver stores the pointer returned by **IoAttachDeviceToDeviceStack** in the device extension of its own device object (FDO) that represents the newly claimed device, and *must use this pointer in all subsequent requests that the class driver sends to the next-lower driver*. The driver also stores the pointer to the input PDO in the device extension, but after **IoAttachDeviceToDeviceStack** returns the driver must use the pointer to the input PDO only in calls to PnP **Io***Xxx* routines that take such a pointer as a parameter.

For more information, see [Writing an AddDevice Routine](../kernel/writing-an-adddevice-routine.md).
