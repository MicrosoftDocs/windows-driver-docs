# SENSOR_CATEGORY_ORIENTATION

The SENSOR_CATEGORY_ORIENTATION category contains sensors that provide information about physical orientation. Compasses provide navigational orientation. Inclinometers measure slope or elevation. Distance sensors measure the proximity of some object to the sensor.

## Platform-defined sensor types

This category includes the following platform-defined sensor types.

| Sensor type | Description |
|---|---|
| **SENSOR_TYPE_AGGREGATED_DEVICE_ORIENTATION** | Specifies the current device orientation by returning a Quaternion and, in some cases, a rotation matrix. (The rotation matrix is optional.) |
| **SENSOR_TYPE_AGGREGATED_QUADRANT_ORIENTATION** | Specifies the current device orientation in degrees. |
| **SENSOR_TYPE_AGGREGATED_SIMPLE_DEVICE_ORIENTATION** | Specifies the device orientation as an enumeration. (This type specifies the device orientation using one of four general quadrants: 0 degrees, 90 degrees counter clockwise, 180-counter clockwise, and 270 degrees counter clockwise.) |

If only **SENSOR_DATA_TYPE_QUATERNION** is implemented, **SENSOR_DATA_TYPE_ROTATION_MATRIX** will be calculated and populated for each data report sent. Devices not using the in-box HID sensor class driver need to calculate and expose both **SENSOR_DATA_TYPE_QUATERNION** and **SENSOR_DATA_TYPE_ROTATION_MATRIX** sensor data fields. |

When quaternions are expressed in normalized format, the values will satisfy the following:<br>![quaternion formula](images/sensor-data-type-quaternion-formula.png) |
| **SENSOR_DATA_TYPE_SIMPLE_DEVICE_ORIENTATION**<br>(PID = 18) | **VT_UI4** | Aggregated device-orientation, specified as an enumeration. (The enumeration values correspond to one of four quadrants.) |
