# I2C transport

The I<sup>2</sup>C (Inter-IC) transport is a two-wire serial transport that was introduced by the Phillips Corporation for their consumer products. Sensors are one category of device that support this transport. Examples include:

- ADXL345 accelerometer
- HMC5883L compass
- MS5611-01BA03 barometric pressure sensor
- TMP100 temperature sensor

The two wires on the I2C bus correspond to a clock-line (SCL) and a serial data-line (SDA). For more information about the I2C transport, see to the I2C Bus Specification.

Sensors that support the I2C transport often support a set of registers. The master uses these registers to configure and control the subordinate device. For the ADXL345, the registers correspond to specific device properties, capabilities, or functionality. Some of the registers are read only; others are read/write. For example, register 0x2D (POWER\_CTL) lets the master set an auto-sleep mode on the sensorâ€”this mode sets the device to a low power state after a certain period of inactivity. (For more information about the ADXL345s registers and commands see to the manufacturer's datasheet.)

The sample driver has a method that writes values to a given register (**CAcclelerometerDevice::WriteRegister**) and one that reads values from a register (**CAccelerometerDevicce::ReadRegister**). They take arguments that identify the register being written to (or read from), a pointer to the data being written or read, and a buffer length for the data buffer.

For example, the following sequence of **WriteRegister** and **ReadRegister** calls takes place during driver and device initialization. The driver invokes **WriteRegister** to configure the sensor. If the operation succeeds, **ReadRegister** returns contents that reflect the previously written values.

```output
Method
Register
Data
Purpose
**CAccelerometerDevice::WriteRegister**
0x2d
'\\0' (0x00)
Reset the sensor's power-control register and place the device in standby mode.
**CAccelerometerDevice::ReadRegister**
0x2d
'\\0' (0x00)
The device has been placed in standby mode.
**CAccelerometerDevice::WriteRegister**
0x31
'\\v' (0x0b)
Set the device in full-resolution mode with a range along each axis of +/- 16G.
**CAccelerometerDevice::ReadRegister**
0x31
'\\v' (0x0b)
Full-resolution has been set with maximum range (+/- 16G).

The complete register map for the accelerometer is in Table 16 of the device's data sheet. The sample driver supports a subset of these registers. These supported values are found within the Adxl345.h header file:
