# Proximity sensor thresholds

There is no configurable threshold defined for proximity sensors.

Proximity sensor drivers must report a sample reading to the sensors class extension by calling [SensorsCxSensorDataReady](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/sensorscx/nf-sensorscx-sensorscxsensordataready) whenever the PKEY_SensorData_ProximityDetection value changes.
The proximity sensor drivers should never report in a row two proximity readings to the class extension unless PKEY_SensorData_ProximityDetection has changed.

That said, proximity sensor drivers must always report one sample reading immediately after the sensors class extension calls the [EvtSensorStart](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/sensorscx/ns-sensorscx-_sensor_controller_config) callback. This sample is known as the known as *initial sample reading*.
