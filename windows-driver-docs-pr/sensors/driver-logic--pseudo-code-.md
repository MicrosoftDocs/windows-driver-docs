# Sensor driver logic

This section describes key driver logic, or tasks, as pseudocode. These tasks include the driver's support for the following client actions:

- Client connects
- Client subscribes to events
- Client unsubscribes from events
- Client disconnects

A client connects when a desktop application invokes the **ISensorCollection::GetAt** method. This method returns an **ISensor** interface for the desired sensor. When the application releases this interface, it disconnects the client.

A client subscribes to events when a desktop application invokes the **ISensorManager:SetEventSink** method. When the application releases the event sink returned by this method, the client unsubscribes from events.

## Abbreviations and variables

The pseudocode in this section uses the following abbreviations.

| Abbreviation | Explanation                                                                                               |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| CRI          | Current report interval (specified in milliseconds)                                                       |
| CS           | Change sensitivity (values are dependent on sensor type)                                                  |
| CS\[\]       | Array of change sensitivities for all data fields (for example, a 3-axis accelerometer has three entries) |
| LDA          | Location desired accuracy (applies to location only)                                                      |
| RS           | Reporting state (indicates whether eventing is enabled or disabled)                                       |
| PS           | Power state (can be off, low, or high)                                                                    |

The pseudocode contains the following variables.

| Variable    | Description                                                                          |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| sensorID    | Unique identifier for a given sensor                                                 |
| clientID    | Unique identifier for a given client                                                 |
| flagCRI     | Set to True if at least one client has specified the current report interval         |
| flagCS      | Set to True if at least one client has specified the change sensitivity for a device |
| flagLDA     | Set to True if at least one client has specified the location desired accuracy       |
| deviceState | Indicates the driver is connected to the device                                      |

## Driver methods

A sensor driver must support both client and device initialization. The pseudocode demonstrates this using the following methods:

- DriverClientInitialize
- DeviceSensorInitialize

A sensor driver supports the platform's device-driver interface (DDI). The pseudocode demonstrates this using the following methods:

- DDIOnClientConnect
- DDIOnClientDisconnect
- DDIOnClientSubscribeToEvents
- DDIOnClientUnsubscribeFromEvents
- DDIOnSetCRI
- DDIOnSetCS
- DDIOnSetLDA
- DDIOnGetProperties
- DDIOnGetDatafields
- DDIHandleAsyncDataEvent

A sensor driver supports internal methods that handle updates to the current report interval, change sensitivity, and so on. The pseudocode demonstrates this using the following methods:

- DriverUpdateCRI
- DriverUpdateCS
- DriverUpdateLDA
- DriverUpdateSensorState
- DriverUpdateDatafields

A sensor driver supports methods that update the sensor device. The pseudocode demonstrates this using the following methods:

- DriverUpdateDeviceCRI
- DriverUpdateDeviceCS
- DriverUpdateDeviceLDA
- DriverUpdateDeviceRS
- DriverUpdateDevicePS

A sensor driver supports methods that interface with a device containing multiple sensors. The pseudocode demonstrates this using the following method:

- DriverUpdateDeviceState

If a sensor driver supports HID sensors, it may support the following methods:

- HIDSensorPollData
- HIDSensorDeviceEvent
- HIDSensorSetProperties
- HIDSensorGetProperties

If a sensor driver supports HID sensors, it may support the following method for a device that contains multiple sensors:

- HIDDeviceManagePower

If a sensor driver supports simple sensors (for example, I2C or SPI), it may support the following methods:

- SpbSensorPollData
- SpbSensorDeviceEvent

## Driver structures and enumerations

A HID driver supports input reports. The pseudocode uses the following data structure to represent a report.

```cpp
struct _inputReport
{
    reportID
    senstate
    eventType
    sensorData //this varies from sensor to sensor

} buffer, pbuffer
```

A sensor driver saves client data. The pseudocode uses the following data structure to save client data.

```cpp
struct clientEntry
{
    clientCRI
    clientCS[]
    clientLDA
    clientSubscribed
}
```

A sensor driver needs to represent the device state. The pseudocode uses the following enumeration to represent the device state.

```cpp
enum deviceState
{
    deviceStateDisconnected // driver is disconnected from the device
    deviceStateConnected //driver is connected to the device
}
```

A sensor driver needs to represent the device state. The pseudocode uses the following enumeration to represent the device state.

```cpp
enum deviceState
{
    deviceStateDisconnected // driver is disconnected from the device
    deviceStateConnected //driver is connected to the device
}
```
