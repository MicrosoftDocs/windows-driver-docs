# Collection list serialization helpers

The collection list serialization helper functions are used by the v2 sensor drivers, for performing serialization-related operations on [**SENSOR\_COLLECTION\_LIST**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/sensorsdef/ns-sensorsdef-sensor_collection_list) structures.

The helper functions are used along with the sensor device driver software interface (DDSI). And because these helper functions are architecture-independent, it is safe to use them for data transfer across process boundaries. For example, it is safe to use these helper functions during a call to DeviceIoControl.

**SerializationBufferAllocate**

Usage by sensor DDSI

- Allocates a serialization buffer, and returns a pointer to the buffer.

Comments

- A successful buffer allocation is indicated by a STATUS\_OK value. Otherwise, the appropriate NTSTATUS error code is returned.

**SerializationBufferFree**

Usage by sensor DDSI

- Frees a serialization buffer that is no longer needed.

Comments

- None.

**CollectionsListGetSerializedSize**

Usage by sensor DDSI

- Retrieves the size of the serialization buffer.

Comments

- Buffer size is returned as a ULONG variable.

**CollectionsListSerializeToBuffer**

Usage by sensor DDSI

- Writes the [**SENSOR\_COLLECTION\_LIST**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/sensorsdef/ns-sensorsdef-sensor_collection_list) information to the serialization buffer.

Comments

- A successful write operation is indicated by a STATUS\_OK value. Otherwise, the appropriate NTSTATUS error code is returned.

**CollectionsListAllocateBufferAndSerialize**

Usage by sensor DDSI

- Allocates a serialization buffer, and then writes the [**SENSOR\_COLLECTION\_LIST**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/sensorsdef/ns-sensorsdef-sensor_collection_list) information to the buffer.

Comments

- If buffer allocation is successful, the collection list information is written to the buffer. Otherwise, the write operation is not performed and the appropriate NTSTATUS error code is returned.

- A successful write operation is indicated by a STATUS\_OK value. Otherwise, the appropriate NTSTATUS error code is returned.

**CollectionsListDeserializeFromBuffer**

Usage by sensor DDSI

- Reads [**SENSOR\_COLLECTION\_LIST**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/sensorsdef/ns-sensorsdef-sensor_collection_list) information from a source buffer.

Comments

- A successful read operation is indicated by a STATUS\_OK value. Otherwise, the appropriate NTSTATUS error code is returned.
