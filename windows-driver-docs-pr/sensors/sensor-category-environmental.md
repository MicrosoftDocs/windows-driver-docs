# SENSOR_CATEGORY_ENVIRONMENTAL

The SENSOR_CATEGORY_ENVIRONMENTAL category contains sensors that provide information about the surrounding environment or weather.

## Platform-defined Sensor Types

This category includes the following platform-defined sensor types.

| Sensor type | Meaning |
|---|---|
| SENSOR_TYPE_ENVIRONMENTAL_ATMOSPHERIC_PRESSURE | Barometers |
| SENSOR_TYPE_ENVIRONMENTAL_HUMIDITY | Hygrometers |
| SENSOR_TYPE_ENVIRONMENTAL_TEMPERATURE | Thermometers |
| SENSOR_TYPE_ENVIRONMENTAL_WIND_DIRECTION | Weather vanes |
| SENSOR_TYPE_ENVIRONMENTAL_WIND_SPEED | Anemometers |

## Platform-defined Data Fields

This category includes the following platform-defined data fields.

| Data type | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| SENSOR_DATA_TYPE_ATMOSPHERIC_PRESSURE_BAR | VT_R4 | Atmospheric pressure in atmospheres (bars) |
| SENSOR_DATA_TYPE_TEMPERATURE_CELSIUS | VT_R4 | Temperature in degrees Celsius |
| SENSOR_DATA_TYPE_RELATIVE_HUMIDITY_PERCENT | VT_R4 | Relative humidity as a percentage |
| SENSOR_DATA_TYPE_WIND_DIRECTION_DEGREES_ANTICLOCKWISE | VT_R4 | Wind direction relative to magnetic north, in degrees. North is represented as 0.0 (top of the x-axis), with values increasing in an anticlockwise rotation. The z-axis points upwards |
| SENSOR_DATA_TYPE_WIND_SPEED_METERS_PER_SECOND | VT_R4 | Wind speed in meters per second |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Each platform-defined environmental data type **PROPERTYKEY** is based on a common **GUID** that is named SENSOR_DATA_TYPE_ENVIRONMENTAL_GUID. As it is a reserved base value, do not use this **GUID** to define your own property keys.
