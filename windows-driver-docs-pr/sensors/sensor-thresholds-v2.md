# Sensor thresholds

This topic provides information about thresholds applicable to sensor data fields (also known as change sensitivity) related to each sensor. Threshold values mentioned in this topic are used to configure how the sensor hardware filters data sent to applications. Applications can configure thresholds to let the hardware filter out any irrelevant changes in the sensor data. The level of change relevance is configured using Threshold values.
