# Other WDK downloads

The Windows Driver Kit (WDK) is used to develop, test, and deploy Windows Drivers.
This topic contains information about versions of the Windows Driver Kit (WDK),
Enterprise WDK (EWDK), and additional downloads for support purposes. To develop drivers,
use the latest public versions of the Windows Driver Kit (WDK) and tools, available for
download on [Download the Windows Driver Kit (WDK)](./download-the-wdk.md).

To use these earlier versions, you must *first* install the version of
Visual Studio that is appropriate for your targeted platform.

## Runtime requirements

Starting with the Windows 11, version 22H2 release of the WDK and EWDK, the kits support:

* Visual Studio 2022 exclusively
* Building and testing kernel-mode drivers for x64 and Arm64
* Building and testing drivers for Windows 10, Windows Server 2016 and later client and server versions
* Side by side (SxS) support with previous WDK/EWDK

Multiple WDKs and EWDKs can be installed concurrently on the same computer and even be part of the same build system. You can run the Windows 11, version 22H2 WDK on Windows 7 and later.

To target Windows 8.1, Windows 8, and Windows 7, install an older WDK (Windows 11, version 21H2 and previous) and an older version of Visual Studio either on the same machine or on a separate machine. For links to older kits, see the table below.

Certain device-specific stacks (for example graphics) continue to have x86/ARM32 user-mode components to support x86/ARM32 apps.

Additionally, starting with Windows 11, version 22H2 release of the WDK and EWDK, WDF redistributable co-installers are no longer supported. To learn how to work around this change, see [WDK Known Issues](./wdk-known-issues.md).

You can run the Windows 11, version 21H2 WDK (including the WDK for Windows Server 2022) on Windows 7 and later, to develop drivers for the following operating systems:

|Client OS|Server OS|
|-|-|
|Windows 11, version 21H2|Windows Server 2022|
|Windows 10|Windows Server 2019, Windows Server 2016|
|Windows 8.1|Windows Server 2012 R2|
Windows 8|Windows Server 2012|
Windows 7|Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1|

## Step 1: Install Visual Studio

The WDK requires Visual Studio. For more information about system requirements for Visual Studio, see [Visual Studio 2022 System Requirements](/visualstudio/releases/2022/system-requirements).


The following table indicates which Visual Studio version is required for the different releases of the WDK.

| Targeted versions of Windows      | Edition(s) of Visual Studio            |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------|
|Windows 11, version 23H2<br/>Windows 11, version 22H2| [Visual Studio Community 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=Community&rel=17) <br/> [Visual Studio Professional 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=Professional&rel=17) <br/> [Visual Studio Enterprise 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=Enterprise&rel=17)

| Windows 10, version 1809 <br/>Windows 10, version 1803 <br/>Windows 10, version 1709 | [Visual Studio Community 2017](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=Community&rel=15) <br/>[Visual Studio Professional 2017](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=Professional&rel=15) <br/>[Visual Studio Enterprise 2017](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=Enterprise&rel=15) |
| Windows 10, version 1703 <br/>Windows 10, version 1607 | [Visual Studio Express 2015 for Desktop](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=875331) <br/>[Visual Studio Community 2015](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=534599) <br/>[Visual Studio Professional 2015](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=619628) <br/>[Visual Studio Enterprise 2015](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=619629) |
| Windows 8.1 Update <br/>Windows 8.1 | [Visual Studio 2013](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=875331) |
| Windows 8                | [Visual Studio Professional 2012](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=255976) <br/>[Visual Studio Ultimate 2012](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=255982) |

### Configure Visual Studio for Windows 11, version 22H2, version 21H2 and Windows 10, versions 1709, 1803, 1809, 1903, 2004, and Windows Server 2022

When you install Visual Studio, select the **Desktop development with
C++** workload. The Windows 11 Software Development Kit (SDK) is
automatically included and is displayed in the right-hand **Summary**
pane.

To develop drivers for Arm/Arm64, choose **Individual components** and
under **Compilers, build tools, and runtimes** select **Visual C++
compilers and libraries for Arm/Arm64**.

### Install the Windows SDK to target Windows 10, versions 1607 and 1703

If your development targets systems that run Windows 10, version 1607 or Windows 10, version 1703, you should install Visual Studio 2015, and then also download and install the version of the Windows SDK for the targeted version of Windows 10, as identified in the following table.

| Targeted versions of Windows      | Version of Windows SDK            |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Windows 10, version 1703 | [Windows SDK for Windows 10.0.15063.468](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=845298) |
| Windows 10, version 1607 | [Windows SDK for Windows 10.0.14393.795](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=838916) |
| Windows 8.1              | [Windows SDK for Windows 8.1](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=323507) |
| Windows 8                | [Windows SDK for Windows 8](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=226658) |

The Windows SDK was not included in Visual Studio 2015, so you must install the SDK separately. Later versions of Visual Studio include the Windows SDK.

## Step 2: Install the WDK

The WDK is integrated with Visual Studio and Debugging Tools for Windows
(WinDbg). This integrated environment gives you the tools you need to
develop, build, package, deploy, test, and debug drivers.

> [!Note]
> Starting with Windows 10, version 1709, installing the WDK
> will by default install the WDK extensions for Visual Studio. These
> extensions are required for integration of the WDK with Visual Studio.
