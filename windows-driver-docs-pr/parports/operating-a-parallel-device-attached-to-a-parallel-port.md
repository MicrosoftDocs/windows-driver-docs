# Operating a Parallel Device Attached to a Parallel Port





This section describes how a client, in particular, a vendor-supplied function driver for a parallel device, operates a parallel device attached to a parallel port.

The system-supplied bus driver for parallel ports creates a physical device object (PDO) for each parallel device enumerated on a parallel port. The following topics describe how a client operates a parallel device by using the interface provided by the device's PDO:
