# IOCTL and Callback Support for Parallel Ports and Devices





This section provides links to topics that describe how the system-supplied parallel drivers support operating parallel ports and devices attached to parallel ports.

Vendor function drivers for parallel devices that are attached to parallel ports are optional. The system-supplied parallel drivers provide extensive support for directly controlling a parallel device as a raw device, and for operating a device's parent parallel port.

For information about the IOCTLs and callbacks that the system-supplied function driver provides to operate a parallel port, see the following topics:
