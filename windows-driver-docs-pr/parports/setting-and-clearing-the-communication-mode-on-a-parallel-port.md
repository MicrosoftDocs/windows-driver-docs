# Setting and Clearing the Communication Mode on a Parallel Port





A client sets the communication mode on a parallel port by using the following internal device control requests:

[**IOCTL\_INTERNAL\_PARALLEL\_SET\_CHIP\_MODE**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/parallel/ni-parallel-ioctl_internal_parallel_set_chip_mode)

[**IOCTL\_INTERNAL\_PARALLEL\_CLEAR\_CHIP\_MODE**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/parallel/ni-parallel-ioctl_internal_parallel_clear_chip_mode)

A kernel-mode driver can also use the system-supplied [parallel device callback routines](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/_parports/) obtained with an [**IOCTL\_INTERNAL\_GET\_PARALLEL\_PNP\_INFO**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/parallel/ni-parallel-ioctl_internal_get_parallel_pnp_info) request. This request returns a [**PARALLEL\_PNP\_INFORMATION**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/parallel/ns-parallel-_parallel_pnp_information) structure that includes the following pointers to system-supplied callbacks:

-   The **TrySetChipMode** member is a pointer to a [*PPARALLEL\_SET\_CHIP\_MODE*](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/parallel/nc-parallel-pparallel_set_chip_mode) callback, which sets the operating mode of a parallel port.

-   The **ClearChipMode** member is a pointer to a [*PPARALLEL\_CLEAR\_CHIP\_MODE*](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/parallel/nc-parallel-pparallel_clear_chip_mode) callback, which clears the operating mode of a parallel port by resetting the communication mode of the host chipset to IEEE 1284-compatibility mode.

A client must first allocate a parallel port before it can set or clear the communication mode.

A client must first clear the communication mode before it can set a new communication mode. Clearing the communication mode returns the host chipset to IEEE 1284-compatibility mode.

To determine the current mode, a client can use the IOCTL\_INTERNAL\_GET\_PARALLEL\_PNP\_INFO request, which returns a PARALLEL\_PNP\_INFORMATION structure that contains information about the current communication mode.
