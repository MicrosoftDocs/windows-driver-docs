# Operating a Parallel Port





This section describes how a client, in particular, a vendor-supplied function driver for a parallel device, operates a parallel port.

The system-supplied function driver for parallel ports creates a functional device object (FDO) for each parallel port enumerated in the system. The following topics describe how a client operates a parallel port by using the interface provided by the port's FDO:
