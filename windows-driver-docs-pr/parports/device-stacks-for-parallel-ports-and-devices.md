# Device Stacks for Parallel Ports and Devices





This section describes the device stacks created by the system-supplied parallel drivers for parallel ports and devices that are attached to parallel ports.

The following figure shows the type of device stacks that the system-supplied parallel drivers create for parallel ports and devices attached to parallel ports.

Vendor-supplied function drivers for parallel devices that are attached to parallel ports are optional. The system-supplied parallel drivers provide extensive support for directly controlling a parallel device as a raw device, and for controlling a device's parent parallel port.

For more information about how to operate parallel ports and devices that are attached to parallel ports, see:
