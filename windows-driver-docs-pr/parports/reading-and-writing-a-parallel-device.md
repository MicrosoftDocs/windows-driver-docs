# Reading and Writing a Parallel Device





A client reads and writes a parallel device by using [**IRP\_MJ\_READ**](/previous-versions/ff544164(v=vs.85)) and [**IRP\_MJ\_WRITE**](/previous-versions/ff544175(v=vs.85)) requests. A kernel-mode driver can also use the system-supplied [**PPARALLEL\_READ**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/parallel/nc-parallel-pparallel_read) and [**PPARALLEL\_WRITE**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/parallel/nc-parallel-pparallel_write) callback routines. To obtain pointers to the system-supplied read and write callbacks, a kernel-mode driver uses an [**IOCTL\_INTERNAL\_PARCLASS\_CONNECT**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/parallel/ni-parallel-ioctl_internal_parclass_connect) request, which returns a [**PARCLASS\_INFORMATION**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/parallel/ns-parallel-_parclass_information) structure. The **ParallelRead** and **ParallelWrite** members of the PARCLASS\_INFORMATION structure are pointers to the callbacks.

If a client uses read and write I/O requests, the parallel port bus driver queues the requests on the work queue of the parallel device. A client of a parallel device does not have to lock a parallel port before reading and writing a device because the system-supplied bus driver for parallel ports automatically locks and unlocks the port for the client.
