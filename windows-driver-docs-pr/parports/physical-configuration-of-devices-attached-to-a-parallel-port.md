# Physical Configuration of Devices Attached to a Parallel Port





This section describes the typical physical configurations of devices that are attached to a parallel port.

The following figure shows a parallel device attached a parallel port.

Microsoft Windows supports one parallel device attached to a parallel port, which can be a legacy device or a Plug and Play device that complies with the IEEE 1284 standard.

The following figure shows IEEE 1284.3 devices and an end-of-chain IEEE 1284 device that are simultaneously attached to a parallel port.

The IEEE 1284.3 standard specifies that up to four daisy chain devices and an end-of-chain device can be simultaneously attached to a parallel port.

The following table specifies the number of IEEE 1284.3 devices that are supported by each version of Windows.
