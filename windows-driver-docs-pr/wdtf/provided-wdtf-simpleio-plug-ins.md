# Provided WDTF Simple I/O plug-ins

Simple I/O plug-ins are extensions to the Windows Driver Test Framework (WDTF) that implement generic device-specific I/O functionality. If a plug-in exists for the type of device being tested, the [Device Fundamental tests](/windows-hardware/drivers) use the WDTF Simple I/O interfaces to test I/O.

This topic lists the device types that have Simple I/O plug-ins and indicates if there are specific requirements for testing the device. These are the same requirements you need to follow when you use the [Windows Hardware Lab Kit (Windows HLK)](/windows-hardware/test/hlk/). The topic also offers ideas to troubleshoot and triage test failures.

If your device type is not listed, you can create one, see [How to customize I/O for your device using the WDTF Simple I/O Action Plug-in](to-customize-i-o-for-your-device-using-the-wdtf-simple-i-o-action-plug-in.md)

For a list of Device Fundamental tests that have specific requirements, see [Device Fundamental tests that have specific device configuration requirements](#device-fundamental-tests-that-have-specific-device-configuration-requirements)

## Audio

### Requirements

- The device must have at least one render type endpoint connected (speakers, headphones, or the like).

- If the targeted audio device has HDMI video and audio output capability, to perform audio tests, the device must be connected to an HDMI audio capable device such as an HDMI Monitor or an A/V Receiver.

### Type of I/O plug-in performs (audio)

- Plays a sine tune on render type endpoint. Captures audio on a capture type endpoint.

#### How to triage test failures

- Look at failing HRESULT to perform initial triage.
- If test is not responding, use the kernel debugger on the target computer to narrow down the root-cause.
- Run traces:
  - Start kernel traces:

```syntax
xperf.exe -on LOADER+PROC_THREAD+CSWITCH+DISK_IO+HARD_FAULTS+PROFILE+INTERRUPT+NETWORKTRACE+DPC+Latency+POWER -stackwalk ProcessCreate+ProcessDelete+ImageLoad+ImageUnload+ThreadCreate+ThreadDelete+CSwitch+ReadyThread+Profile+DiskFlushInit+FileFlush+RegFlush+HardFault+VirtualAlloc+VirtualFree -BufferSize 1024 -MinBuffers 512 -MaxBuffers 1024 -f Audio_SimpleIo_Kernel.etl
```

- Start audio traces:

```syntax
xperf.exe -start AudioSimpleIo -on Microsoft-Windows-Audio+a6a00efd-21f2-4a99-807e-9b3bf1d90285:0xffff:0x3 -BufferSize 1024 -MinBuffers 512 -MaxBuffers 1024 -f Audio_SimpleIo.etl
```

- Run tests.
- Stop traces:

```syntax
xperf.exe -stop "NT Kernel Logger" Audio_SimpleIo
```

- Merge traces:

```syntax
xperf.exe -merge Audio_SimpleIo_Kernel.etl Audio_SimpleIo.etl Audio_SimpleIo _Merged.etl
```

- View the merged trace file with Xperf (**xperfview**).

## Bluetooth

### Bluetooth requirements

- No special requirements.

#### Type of I/O plug-in performs (Bluetooth)

- Uses [**BluetoothFindFirstDevice function**](/windows/win32/api/bluetoothapis/nf-bluetoothapis-bluetoothfindfirstdevice) to find a Bluetooth device.

## CDROM

### CDROM requirements

- Drive letter is assigned.
- Media is present in the device.
- Files are present on the media inserted.

### Type of I/O plug-in performs (CDROM)

- Finds files on the CD-ROM and performs read operation using the Win32 [**ReadFile**](/windows/win32/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-readfile) API.

### How to triage test failures (CDROM)

- On the test computer, navigate to the CD/DVD drive in question and confirm you can access the contents of the drives.
- The CD-Rom Simple I/O plug-in searches for files on CD/DVD to use to perform reads from. Ensure the CD/DVD has files encoded on disk.
- This Simple I/O plug uses the Win32 [**CreateFile**](/windows/win32/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-createfilea), [**WriteFile**](/windows/win32/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-writefile), [**ReadFile**](/windows/win32/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-readfile) functions. Error returned are most likely Win32 error codes from these APIs.

## Disk

### Disk requirements

- Disk has at least one associated volume Drive letter is assigned.

#### Type of I/O plug-in performs (Disk)

- Uses the Simple I/O plug-in for [Volumes](#volume).

## Display

### Display requirements

- No special requirements for testing.

### Type of I/O plug-in performs (Display)

- Uses D3DX APIs to exercise graphics adapter.

### How to triage test failures (Display)

- Look through the test logs, which report failures from the APIs that are used.

## GPS devices (and GPS devices in systems)

### Requirements (GPS)

- The device must be tested in a location with proper GPS signals.

### Type of I/O plug-in performs (GPS)

- Uses the I/O plug-in for [Sensors](#sensors).

## LAN

### Requirements (LAN)

- Device has an IPv6 address.

- Device has an IPv6 gateway address (otherwise the WDTFREMOTESYSTEM parameter should be passed to the test with an IPv6 address that the test NIC can ping).

- The network operation status of the device is IfOperStatusUp.

- Network device is not a WWAN or a WLAN device.

### Type of I/O plug-in performs (LAN)

- Pings IPv6 network gateway address.

### How to triage test failures (LAN)

- Confirm that there is an existing IP address.
- Confirm that there is a gateway IPv6 IP Address.
- Confirm the IP gateway address manually (use ping.exe).

## Mobile broadband

### Requirements (Mobile broadband)

- No special requirements for testing.

### Type of I/O plug-in performs (Mobile broadband)

- Uses [**IMbnInterface interface**](/windows/win32/api/mbnapi/nn-mbnapi-imbninterface) and calls GetHomeProvider, [**IMbnInterface::GetInterfaceCapability method**](/windows/win32/api/mbnapi/nf-mbnapi-imbninterface-getinterfacecapability), and [**IMbnInterface::GetReadyState method**](/windows/win32/api/mbnapi/nf-mbnapi-imbninterface-getreadystate) APIs to exercise the device.

### How to triage test failures (Mobile broadband)

- The MobileBroadbandPlugin has limited areas it can fail.

  - "MobileBroadbandPlugin: Getting all Mobile Broadband interfaces returned failure."
  - "MobileBroadbandPlugin: Getting the interface returned failure."
  - "MobileBroadbandPlugin: Getting the DeviceId returned."
  - "MobileBroadbandPlugin: Getting the interface capabilities returned failure"
  - "MobileBroadbandPlugin: Getting the ReadyState returned failure."

- The best place to investigate the failure is starting from the device and determine if it was unable to indicate Ready Information or Device Capabilities. To debug further OS Trace file need to be collected.

  - Run the command: **netsh trace start wwan\_dbg**
  - Reproduce the issue.
  - Run the command: **netsh trace stop**

## Portable devices

## Volume

### Requirements (Volume)

- Volume has a drive letter assigned.
- Volume has 5MB of free space.
- Volume is not write-protected.
- Media is present in the device.

### Type of I/O plug-in performs (Volume)

### How to triage test failures (Volume)

- On the test computer, navigate to the drive in question and confirm you can access the contents of the drive.
- Attempt to save a file to the drive. Ensure you can save and access it readily.
- This Simple I/O plug uses the Win32 [**CreateFile**](/windows/win32/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-createfilea), [**WriteFile**](/windows/win32/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-writefile), [**ReadFile**](/windows/win32/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-readfile) functions. Error returned are most likely Win32 error codes from these APIs.
