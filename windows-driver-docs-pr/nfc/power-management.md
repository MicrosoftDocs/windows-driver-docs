# NFP power management

NFP devices operate in one of three power modes. These modes are *active*, *idle*, *standby*, and *power-removed*. The NFP device can enter a low-power mode when publications or subscriptions to the device are disabled. The NFP driver will transition the device to one of the power modes in response to an enable or disable notification from Windows.

The NFP driver will receive an **[IOCTL_NFP_ENABLE](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/nfpdev/ni-nfpdev-ioctl_nfp_enable)** or an **[IOCTL_NFP_DISABLE](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/nfpdev/ni-nfpdev-ioctl_nfp_disable)** control code to enable or disable subscriptions, publications, and presence events. These control codes will also trigger a power mode change for the device. The [Near-field proximity (NFP) power management for connected standby platforms](/windows-hardware/design/device-experiences/near-field-promiximity--nfp--power-management-for-modern-standby-platforms) topic provides detailed description of power mode changes for NFP devices.
