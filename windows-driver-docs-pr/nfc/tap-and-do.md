# Tap and Do


*Tap and Do* is a gesture that is a natural interaction between people in close proximity used to trigger doing something together between the devices they are holding.

Starting with Windows 8, a new gesture is introduced for real world interaction called *Tap and Do*. *Tap and Do* works within a narrow physical volume (on the order of centimeters) so it is very intentional. A programming model maps this intentionality to the triggering of actions between devices within the physical environment. The underlying system of Near Field Proximity (NFP) is primarily modeled on technologies that use electromagnetic fields, such as NFC, but the platform is flexible and other innovative systems that meet the NFP requirements are supported. Windows provides a user model based on NFP that is easy to understand, lightweight, and intuitive. Windows includes with a number of built-in experiences that leverage NFP. The API is available for third-party development.
