# Configurability

In addition to extensibility points available to the NFC client driver, the NFC CX also enables the client driver to configure the parameters of many of its operations. The following configurations can be customized by the NFC client driver.

- Driver Flags
- RF Discovery Configuration
- LLCP Configuration

## Driver Flags

The NFC CX allows the NFC client driver to provide **[driver flags](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/nfccx/ne-nfccx-_nfc_cx_driver_flags)** to configure the run-time implementation of the class extension. These flags allow the NFC CX to implement certain standard NCI operation slightly differently, due to different firmware implementations due to ambiguities in the NCI specification.

## RF Discovery Configuration

The RF discovery configuration can be set by the NFC client driver through the **[NfcCxSetRfDiscoveryConfig](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/nfccx/nf-nfccx-nfccxsetrfdiscoveryconfig)** method. The RF discovery configuration should be done during initialization after calling **[NfcCxDeviceInitialize](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/nfccx/nf-nfccx-nfccxdeviceinitialize)**, otherwise an error is returned.

## LLCP Configuration

The LLCP configuration can be set by the NFC client driver through the **[NfcCxSetLlcpConfig](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/nfccx/nf-nfccx-nfccxsetllcpconfig)** method provided by the NFC CX. The LLCP configuration should be done during initialization after **[NfcCxDeviceInitialize](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/nfccx/nf-nfccx-nfccxdeviceinitialize)**, otherwise an error is returned.
