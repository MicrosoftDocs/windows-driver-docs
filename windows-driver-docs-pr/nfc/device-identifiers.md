# NFP device identifiers

The following are the device identifiers for NFP device drivers:

- Device Interface Class
  - GUID_DEVINTERFACE_NFP
  - "{FB3842CD-9E2A-4F83-8FCC-4B0761139AE9}"
- Device Class GUID
  - "{5630831C-06C9-4856-B327-F5D32586E060}"
- Device Class
  - "Proximity"
  - This is an OS-defined Device Class starting with WindowsÂ 8. Drivers that expose this interface must match this Device Class.
- DEVPKEY_NFP_Capabilities
  - 0xFB3842CD, 0x9E2A, 0x4F83, 0x8F, 0xCC, 0x4B, 0x07, 0x61, 0x13, 0x9A, 0xE9, 0x02

If the device is advertised as NFC, the driver MUST populate DEVPKEY_NFP_Capabilities on the exposed GUID_DEVINTERFACE_NFP interface with a DEVPROP_TYPE_STRING_LIST property containing one entry: "StandardNfc".
