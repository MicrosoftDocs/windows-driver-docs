# NFC class extension (CX) design guide

This section describes the interface between the NFC class extension (CX) and the NFC client driver. The NFC CX driver implements all NFC device driver interfaces and standard NFC protocols and formats based on the *NFC Forum NFC Controller Interface (NCI) Technical Specification*.

The NFC client driver is responsible for transport layer interfacing as well as support for any non-standard vendor-defined extensions for the optimized functioning of the NFC controller.

The NFC class extension driver implements all standard NFC Forum Tag (T1T, T2T, T3T, ISO-DEP) and P2P (LLCP and SNEP) protocols, and RF Management based on the NCI Core specification. The class extension driver implements all the Windows-defined device driver interfaces to interact with the NFC controller, Secure Elements, and Remote RF endpoints.

These topics describe the architecture and public interface between the NFC class extension driver supplied by Microsoft and the NFC client driver supplied by the corresponding chipset manufacturers. The NFC CX driver is designed to support NFC chipsets from various manufacturers, and enables manufacturers to implement non-NCI standard functionality in their NFC client driver for differentiation purposes.

## NFC driver DDI

The following are the Windows-defined NFC driver DDI that are implemented by the NFC CX driver:
