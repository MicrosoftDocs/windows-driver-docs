# Do you need to write a driver?


Microsoft Windows contains built-in drivers for many device types. If there is a built-in driver for your device type, you won't need to write your own driver. Your device can use the built-in driver.

## <span id="Built-in_drivers_for_USB_devices"></span><span id="built-in_drivers_for_usb_devices"></span><span id="BUILT-IN_DRIVERS_FOR_USB_DEVICES"></span>Built-in drivers for USB devices


If your device belongs to a device class that is defined by the USB Device Working Group (DWG), there may already be an existing Windows USB class driver for it. For more information, see [Drivers for the Supported USB Device Classes](../usbcon/supported-usb-classes.md).

Currently, Microsoft provides built-in drivers for the following other types of devices:

<td align="left"><p>Microsoft provides support for SD card readers as follows: The operating system provides support for SD host controllers that connect directly to the PCI bus. When the system enumerates an SD host controller, it loads a native SD bus driver (sdbus.sys). If a user inserts an SD memory card, Windows loads a native SD storage class driver (sffdisk.sys) and storage miniport driver (sffp_sd.sys) on top of the bus driver. These SD storage drivers are unified under a single driver named sdstor.sys for Windows 8 and later operating system. If a user inserts an SD card with a different kind of function, such as GPS or wireless LAN, Windows loads a vendor-supplied driver for the device.</p></td>
