# Bluetooth Driver Testing Resources

These resources support Bluetooth driver testing.

- The [Windows Hardware Lab Kit](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/test/hlk/) provides a test framework to build a test environment, automate driver and system testing, and create a submission package required to participate in the [Windows Hardware Compatibility Program](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/design/compatibility/)

- The [Windows Performance Recorder](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-8.1-and-8/hh448205(v=win.10)) is a performance recording tool based on Event Tracing for Windows (ETW). Creation of tracing and logging scripts specific to Bluetooth is detailed in [The Bus tools for Windows Repo on GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/busiotools/blob/master/bluetooth/tracing/readme.md).

- The [Bluetooth Test Platform (BTP)](testing-BTP-Overview.md) is designed for automating testing of Bluetooth hardware, drivers, and software. BTP can be used to exercise Bluetooth radios both in the host (PC) and peripherals.
