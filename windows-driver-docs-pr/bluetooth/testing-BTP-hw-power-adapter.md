# Traduci power adapter

Certain test cases will require more power than the USB VBus can provide to the Traduci and its attached BT devices. In these instances the test will identify in documentation that an external power adapter is required.  

| Test | Adapter Required | Adapter Recommended |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Power State HID tests](testing-BTP-tests-power-state-hid.md) | Yes | N/A |
| [Audio and HID Scenario Tests](testing-BTP-tests-audio-hid.md) | No | Yes |
| [Wi-Fi and Bluetooth Audio Coexistence Tests](testing-BTP-tests-wifi.md) | No | Yes |

## Requirements

The power adapter chosen must meet the following specification:

- 9V DC
- 1A (minimum)
- Positive Center
- 2.1mm inner diameter (id) barrel
- 5.5mm outer diameter (od) barrel

## Availability

The 9V DC 1000mA power adapter from Adafruit meets these requirements and can be purchased via [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/63).

Any other power adapters that meet the above specification can be used as well.
