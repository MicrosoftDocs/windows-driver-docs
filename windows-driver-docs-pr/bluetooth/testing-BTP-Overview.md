# Overview

The Bluetooth Test Platform (BTP) provides automated testing of Bluetooth hardware, drivers, and software. BTP can be used to exercise Bluetooth radios and software stacks both in the host (PC) and peripheral devices. It's an extensible framework, which allows many companies to contribute.
