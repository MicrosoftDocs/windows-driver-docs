# Get the Microsoft Bluetooth Test Platform software package

The Bluetooth Test Platform (BTP) software package contains everything that needs to be installed on your test machine to test the interoperability of Bluetooth enabled devices with the Windows Bluetooth stack. The included documentation provides information about how to configure the hardware and suggests topologies for the best test coverage as well as the details for how to run the tests and collect logs.

## Download the BTP software package

Click the following button to download the latest version.

> [!NOTE]
> The installer should be run on the machine that will be executing the tests. After installation, do not copy, move or delete files. If you have a problem with your installation, use Windows "Add or Remove Programs" to completely uninstall BTP. Then do a clean install with the msi.
