# Isochronous I/O for IEEE 1394 Devices





Real-time multimedia devices such as digital cameras need large amounts of bandwidth to send data in a steady stream, but do not require guaranteed delivery. (For example, a dropped frame from a digital camera would degrade the quality of the signal, but it would not destroy its meaning.) For such devices, IEEE 1394 provides *isochronous* transfer, which provides guaranteed bandwidth, but does not guarantee delivery.
