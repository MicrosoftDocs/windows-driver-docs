# Introduction to KTM


The Kernel transaction manager (KTM) is a transaction management service that enables you to create a transaction processing system (TPS) in user mode or kernel mode (or both).

KTM is a kernel-mode service of the Microsoft Windows operating system. KTM is available on Windows Vista and later versions of Windows.

KTM provides both user-mode and kernel-mode interfaces. This documentation describes the kernel-mode interfaces of KTM. For information about the Microsoft Win32 user-mode interfaces, see the Microsoft Windows SDK.

For more information about transaction theory, see the book titled *Transaction Processing: Concepts and Techniques* by Jim Gray and Andreas Reuter.
