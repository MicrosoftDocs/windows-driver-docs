# WDM Versions


Although Microsoft Windows 2000 and later versions of the NT-based operating system, along with Windows 98 and Windows Me, all support various versions of WDM, incremental changes to WDM have resulted in later-released operating systems supporting additional WDM features that earlier releases do not support. Later versions of WDM generally support all the features available in earlier versions of WDM; that is, each new version of WDM is a superset of the previous WDM version. When possible, a cross-system driver should conform to the lowest WDM version on any operating system.
