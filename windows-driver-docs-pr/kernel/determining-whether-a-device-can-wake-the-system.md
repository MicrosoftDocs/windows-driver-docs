# Determining Whether a Device Can Wake the System





Some devices, such as keyboards, modems, and network cards, can respond to external signals while in a device sleep state. As part of its power management technology, the operating system provides a way for such devices to wake a sleeping system, which can then restore its previous context. The software wake-up mechanism allows a system to awaken from any state except S5 (**PowerSystemShutdown**), depending on support in the system and device hardware and BIOS. A system in state S5 must always be rebooted.

Although the operating system is designed to awaken from any of the intermediate sleep states, the exact wake-up capabilities vary from computer to computer and device to device. Not all computers support all system sleep states; therefore, the ability to wake from certain states is meaningless on some computers.

Similarly, most devices neither support all device power states (D0 through D3) nor support wake-up from all the device power states that they do support.

The sleep states that a device can enter, along with the states from which it supports wake up, are described at enumeration by the bus driver and are stored in the [**DEVICE\_CAPABILITIES**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/ns-wdm-_device_capabilities) structure. The following table lists the members of this structure that are relevant to wait/wake support.

The **DeviceWake** entry lists the lowest device power state from which the device can respond to a wake-up signal. The value PowerDeviceUnspecified indicates that the device cannot wake the system. The **SystemWake** entry lists the lowest system power state from which the system can be awakened. These values are based on the capabilities of the parent devnode and drivers should not change them. For more information, see [Reporting Device Power Capabilities](reporting-device-power-capabilities.md).

In general, a device can wake the system if the following are true:

-   The device is in a power state equal to or more-powered than the **DeviceWake** value.

-   The system is in a power state equal to or more powered than the **SystemWake** value.
