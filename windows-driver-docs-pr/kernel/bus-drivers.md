# Bus Drivers





A *bus driver* services a bus controller, adapter, or bridge (see the [Possible Driver Layers](types-of-wdm-drivers.md#possible-driver-layers) figure). Microsoft provides bus drivers for most common buses, such as PCI, PnpISA, SCSI, and USB. Other bus drivers can be provided by IHVs or OEMs. Bus drivers are required drivers; there is one bus driver for each type of bus on a machine. A bus driver can service more than one bus if there is more than one bus of the same type on the machine.

The primary responsibilities of a bus driver are to:

-   Enumerate the devices on its bus.

-   Respond to Plug and Play IRPs and power management IRPs.

-   Multiplex access to the bus (for some buses).

-   Generically administer the devices on its bus.

Bus drivers are essentially [function drivers](function-drivers.md) that also enumerate children.

During enumeration, a bus driver identifies the devices on its bus and creates device objects for them. (For information about device objects, see [Device Objects and Device Stacks](introduction-to-device-objects.md).) The method a bus driver uses to identify connected devices depends on the particular bus.

A bus driver performs certain operations on behalf of the devices on its bus, including accessing device registers to physically change the power state of a device. For example, when the device goes to sleep, the bus driver sets device registers to put the device in the proper device power state.

Note, however, that a bus driver does not handle read and write requests for the child devices that are connected to its bus. Read and write requests to a child device are handled by the child device's [function driver](function-drivers.md). Only if the child device is being used in *raw mode* does the parent bus driver handle reads and writes for the device.

Because a bus driver acts as the function driver for its controller, adapter, or bridge, it also manages device power policy for these components.

A bus driver can be implemented as a driver/minidriver pair, the way a SCSI port/miniport driver pair drives a SCSI host bus adapter (HBA). In such driver pairs, the minidriver is linked to the second driver, which is a DLL.
