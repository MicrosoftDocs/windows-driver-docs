# Introduction to Cancel Routines





Any driver in which IRPs can be held in a pending state for an indefinite interval must have one or more [*Cancel*](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nc-wdm-driver_cancel) routines. For example, a keyboard driver might wait indefinitely for a user to press a key. Conversely, if a driver will never queue more IRPs than it can complete in five minutes, it probably does not need a *Cancel* routine.

Suppose a user-mode thread makes an I/O request, which is queued by a highest-level device driver's dispatch routine, and the requesting thread is terminated while the IRP is queued. IRPs queued on behalf of a terminated thread should be canceled. Consequently, the driver must set a driver-supplied *Cancel* routine in each IRP that it queues.

A driver that creates associated IRPs must cancel them when the master IRP is canceled. Because associated IRPs are not associated with a requesting thread, the master IRP's *Cancel* routine is responsible for canceling any associated IRPs when the master IRP is canceled.

The number of *Cancel* routines any driver has depends on the driver's design. In general, a driver should have a *Cancel* routine for each stage in its I/O processing at which an IRP might be held in a pending state for an indefinite interval. Such pending IRPs are said to be *held in a cancelable state*.

Consider the following design guidelines:

-   The highest-level driver in a chain of layered drivers must have at least one *Cancel* routine if it queues IRPs or otherwise holds IRPs in a cancelable state. It can have more than one *Cancel* routine, if necessary.

-   Lower-level drivers in which IRPs can be held in a cancelable state for relatively long intervals also should have one or more *Cancel* routines.

-   If a driver manages its own internal queues of IRPs, it should have a separate *Cancel* routine for each of its queues.

Some highest-level drivers for interactive devices, such as keyboard, mouse, sound, parallel class and serial drivers, must have *Cancel* routines. Some lower-level drivers, such as a parallel port driver that holds IRPs queued for some number of higher-level class drivers for relatively long intervals, also should have *Cancel* routines.

Mass-storage device drivers, along with intermediate drivers layered over them, are unlikely to have *Cancel* routines. It is the responsibility of a file system driver to handle the cancellation of file I/O requests, while the IRPs input to lower-level mass-storage drivers are usually processed to completion too quickly to be cancelable.
