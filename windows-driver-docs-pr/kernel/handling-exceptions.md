# Handling Exceptions





The operating system uses structured exception handling to signal certain kinds of errors. A routine called by a driver can raise an exception that the driver must handle.

The system traps the following general kinds of exceptions:

1.  Hardware-defined faults or traps, such as,

    -   Access violations (see below)
    -   Data-type misalignments (such as a 16-bit entity aligned on an odd-byte boundary)
    -   Illegal and privileged instructions
    -   Invalid lock sequences (attempting to execute an invalid sequence of instructions within an interlocked section of code)
    -   Integer divides by zero and overflows
    -   Floating-point divides by zero, overflows, underflows, and reserved operands
    -   Breakpoints and single step execution (to support debuggers)

2.  System software-defined exceptions, such as,

    -   Guard-page violations (attempting to load or store data from or to a location within a guard page)
    -   Page-read errors (attempting to read a page into memory and encountering a concurrent I/O error)

An *access violation* is an attempt to perform an operation on a page that is not permitted under the current page protection settings. Access violations occur in the following situations:

-   An invalid read or write operation, such as writing to a read-only page.

-   To access memory beyond the limit of the current program's address space (known as a length violation).

-   To access a page that is currently resident but dedicated to the use of a system component. For example, user-mode code is not allowed access a page that the kernel is using.

If an operation might cause an exception, the driver should enclose the operation in a **try/except** block. Accesses of locations in user-mode are typical causes of exceptions. For example, the [**ProbeForWrite**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-probeforwrite) routine checks that the driver can actually write to a user-mode buffer. If it cannot, the routine raises a STATUS\_ACCESS\_VIOLATION exception. In the following code example, the driver calls **ProbeForWrite** in a **try/except** so that it can handle the resulting exception, if one should occur.

```cpp
try {
    ...
    ProbeForWrite(Buffer, BufferSize, BufferAlignment);
 
    /* Note that any access (not just the probe, which must come first,
     * by the way) to Buffer must also be within a try-except.
     */
    ...
} except (EXCEPTION_EXECUTE_HANDLER) {
    /* Error handling code */
    ...
}
```

Drivers must handle any raised exceptions. An exception that is not handled causes the system to bug check. The driver that causes the exception to be raised must handle it: a lower-level driver cannot rely on a higher-level driver to handle the exception.

Drivers can directly raise an exception, by using the [**ExRaiseAccessViolation**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ntddk/nf-ntddk-exraiseaccessviolation), [**ExRaiseDatatypeMisalignment**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ntddk/nf-ntddk-exraisedatatypemisalignment), or [**ExRaiseStatus**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-exraisestatus) routines. The driver must handle any exceptions that these routines raise.

The following is a partial list of routines that, at least in certain situations, can raise an exception:

-   [**MmMapLockedPages**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-mmmaplockedpages)

-   [**MmProbeAndLockPages**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-mmprobeandlockpages)

-   [**ProbeForRead**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-probeforread)

-   [**ProbeForWrite**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-probeforwrite)

Memory accesses to user-mode buffers can also cause access violations. For more information, see [Errors in Referencing User-Space Addresses](errors-in-referencing-user-space-addresses.md).

Note that structured exception handling is distinct from C++ exceptions. The kernel does not support C++ exceptions.

For more information about structured exception handling, see the Microsoft Windows SDK, and the Visual Studio documentation.
