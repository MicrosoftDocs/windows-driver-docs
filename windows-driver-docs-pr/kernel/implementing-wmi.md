# Implementing WMI





This section describes kernel-mode Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) extensions to WDM. When you add these extensions to your kernel-mode driver, your driver becomes a WMI provider. A WMI provider makes measurement and instrumentation data available to WMI consumers, such as user-mode applications.

For more information about the user-mode WMI API, refer to [Windows Management Instrumentation](/windows/desktop/WmiSdk/wmi-start-page) in the Windows SDK.

If you are implementing a KMDF-based driver, refer to [Supporting WMI in Framework-Based Drivers](../wdf/introduction-to-wmi-for-kmdf-drivers.md).
