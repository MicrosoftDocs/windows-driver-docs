# Different ways of handling IRPs - Cheat sheet 

A Windows Driver Model (WDM) driver typically sends input/output request packets (IRPs) to other drivers. A driver either creates its own IRP and sends it to a lower driver, or the driver forwards the IRPs that it receives from another driver that is attached above. 

This article discusses different ways that a driver can send IRPs to a lower driver and includes annotated sample code.

* Scenarios 1-5 are about how to forward an IRP to a lower driver from a dispatch routine.
* Scenarios 6-12 discuss different ways of creating an IRP and sending it to another driver.

Before you examine the various scenarios, note that an IRP completion routine can return either STATUS_MORE_PROCESSING_REQUIRED or STATUS_SUCCESS.

The I/O manager uses the following rules when it examines the status:

* If the status is STATUS_MORE_PROCESSING_REQUIRED, stop completing the IRP, leave the stack location unchanged and return.
* If the status is anything other than STATUS_MORE_PROCESSING_REQUIRED, continue completing the IRP upward.

Because the I/O Manager does not have to know which non-STATUS_MORE_PROCESSING_REQUIRED value is used, use STATUS_SUCCESS (because the value 0 loads efficiently on most processor architectures).

As you read the following code, note that STATUS_CONTINUE_COMPLETION is aliased to STATUS_SUCCESS in the WDK.

```cpp
// This value should be returned from completion routines to continue
// completing the IRP upwards. Otherwise, STATUS_MORE_PROCESSING_REQUIRED
// should be returned.
// 
#define STATUS_CONTINUE_COMPLETION      STATUS_SUCCESS
// 
// Completion routines can also use this enumeration instead of status codes.
// 
typedef enum _IO_COMPLETION_ROUTINE_RESULT {

    ContinueCompletion = STATUS_CONTINUE_COMPLETION,
    StopCompletion = STATUS_MORE_PROCESSING_REQUIRED

} IO_COMPLETION_ROUTINE_RESULT, *PIO_COMPLETION_ROUTINE_RESULT;
```

## Forwarding an IRP to another driver

### Scenario 1: Forward and forget
Use the following code if a driver just wants to forward the IRP down and take no additional action. The driver does not have to set a completion routine in this case. If the driver is a top level driver, the IRP can be completed synchronously or asynchronously, depending on the status that is returned by the lower driver. 

```cpp
NTSTATUS
DispatchRoutine_1(
    IN PDEVICE_OBJECT DeviceObject,
    IN PIRP Irp
    )
{
    // 
    // You are not setting a completion routine, so just skip the stack
    // location because it provides better performance.
    // 
    IoSkipCurrentIrpStackLocation (Irp);
    return IoCallDriver(TopOfDeviceStack, Irp);
} 
```

### Scenario 2: Forward and wait

Use the following code if a driver wants to forward the IRP to a lower driver and wait for it to return so that it can process the IRP. This is frequently done when handling PNP IRPs. For example, when you receive a [IRP_MN_START_DEVICE](irp-mn-start-device.md) IRP, you must forward the IRP down to the bus driver and wait for it to complete before you can start your device. You can call [**IoForwardIrpSynchronously**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-ioforwardirpsynchronously) to do this operation easily.

```cpp
NTSTATUS
DispatchRoutine_2(
    IN PDEVICE_OBJECT DeviceObject,
    IN PIRP Irp
    )
{
    KEVENT   event;
    NTSTATUS status;

    KeInitializeEvent(&event, NotificationEvent, FALSE);

    // 
    // You are setting completion routine, so you must copy
    // current stack location to the next. You cannot skip a location
    // here.
    // 
    IoCopyCurrentIrpStackLocationToNext(Irp);

    IoSetCompletionRoutine(Irp,
                           CompletionRoutine_2,
                           &event,
                           TRUE,
                           TRUE,
                           TRUE
                           );

    status = IoCallDriver(TopOfDeviceStack, Irp);

    if (status == STATUS_PENDING) {

       KeWaitForSingleObject(&event,
                             Executive, // WaitReason
                             KernelMode, // must be Kernelmode to prevent the stack getting paged out
                             FALSE,
                             NULL // indefinite wait
                             );
       status = Irp->IoStatus.Status;
    }

    // <---- Do your own work here.


    // 
    // Because you stopped the completion of the IRP in the CompletionRoutine
    // by returning STATUS_MORE_PROCESSING_REQUIRED, you must call
    // IoCompleteRequest here.
    // 
    IoCompleteRequest (Irp, IO_NO_INCREMENT);
    return status;

}
NTSTATUS
CompletionRoutine_2(
    IN PDEVICE_OBJECT   DeviceObject,
    IN PIRP             Irp,
    IN PVOID            Context
    )
{ 
  if (Irp->PendingReturned == TRUE) {
    // 
    // You will set the event only if the lower driver has returned
    // STATUS_PENDING earlier. This optimization removes the need to
    // call KeSetEvent unnecessarily and improves performance because the
    // system does not have to acquire an internal lock.  
    // 
    KeSetEvent ((PKEVENT) Context, IO_NO_INCREMENT, FALSE);
  }
  // This is the only status you can return. 
  return STATUS_MORE_PROCESSING_REQUIRED;  
} 
```

### Scenario 3: Forward with a completion routine

In this case, the driver sets a completion routine, forwards the IRP down, and then returns the status of lower driver as is. The purpose of setting the completion routine is to modify the content of the IRP on its way back. 

```cpp
NTSTATUS
DispatchRoutine_3(
    IN PDEVICE_OBJECT DeviceObject,
    IN PIRP Irp
    )
{
    NTSTATUS status;

    // 
    // Because you are setting completion routine, you must copy the
    // current stack location to the next. You cannot skip a location
    // here.
    // 
    IoCopyCurrentIrpStackLocationToNext(Irp); 

    IoSetCompletionRoutine(Irp,
                           CompletionRoutine_31,// or CompletionRoutine_32
                           NULL,
                           TRUE,
                           TRUE,
                           TRUE
                           );

    return IoCallDriver(TopOfDeviceStack, Irp);
}
```

If you return the status of the lower driver from your dispatch routine:

* You must not change the status of the IRP in the completion routine. This is to make sure that the status values set in the IRP's IoStatus block (Irp->IoStatus.Status) are the same as the return status of the lower drivers.
* You must propagate the pending status of the IRP as indicated by Irp->PendingReturned.
* You must not change the synchronicity of the IRP.

As a result, there are only 2 valid versions of the completion routine in this scenario (31 and 32):

```cpp
NTSTATUS
CompletionRoutine_31 (
    IN PDEVICE_OBJECT   DeviceObject,
    IN PIRP             Irp,
    IN PVOID            Context
    )
{   

    // 
    // Because the dispatch routine is returning the status of lower driver
    // as is, you must do the following:
    // 
    if (Irp->PendingReturned) {

        IoMarkIrpPending( Irp );
    }

    return STATUS_CONTINUE_COMPLETION ; // Make sure of same synchronicity 
}

NTSTATUS
CompletionRoutine_32 (
    IN PDEVICE_OBJECT   DeviceObject,
    IN PIRP             Irp,
    IN PVOID            Context
    )
{   
    // 
    // Because the dispatch routine is returning the status of lower driver
    // as is, you must do the following:
    // 
    if (Irp->PendingReturned) {

        IoMarkIrpPending( Irp );
    }

    //    
    // To make sure of the same synchronicity, complete the IRP here.
    // You cannot complete the IRP later in another thread because the 
    // the dispatch routine is returning the status returned by the lower
    // driver as is.
    // 
    IoCompleteRequest( Irp,  IO_NO_INCREMENT);  

    // 
    // Although this is an unusual completion routine that you rarely see,
    // it is discussed here to address all possible ways to handle IRPs.  
    // 
    return STATUS_MORE_PROCESSING_REQUIRED; 
} 
```

### Scenario 4: Queue for later, or forward and reuse

Use the following code snippet in a situation where the driver wants to either queue an IRP and process it later or forward the IRP to the lower driver and reuse it for a specific number of times before completing the IRP. The dispatch routine marks the IRP pending and returns STATUS_PENDING because the IRP is going to be completed later in a different thread. Here, the completion routine can change the status of the IRP if necessary (in contrast to the previous scenario). 

```cpp
NTSTATUS
DispathRoutine_4(
    IN PDEVICE_OBJECT DeviceObject,
    IN PIRP Irp
    )
{
    NTSTATUS status;

    // 
    // You mark the IRP pending if you are intending to queue the IRP
    // and process it later. If you are intending to forward the IRP 
    // directly, use one of the methods discussed earlier in this article.
    // 
    IoMarkIrpPending( Irp );    

    // 
    // For demonstration purposes: this IRP is forwarded to the lower driver.
    // 
    IoCopyCurrentIrpStackLocationToNext(Irp); 

    IoSetCompletionRoutine(Irp,
                           CompletionRoutine_41, // or CompletionRoutine_42
                           NULL,
                           TRUE,
                           TRUE,
                           TRUE
                           ); 
    IoCallDriver(TopOfDeviceStack, Irp);

    // 
    // Because you marked the IRP pending, you must return pending,
    // regardless of the status of returned by IoCallDriver.
    // 
    return STATUS_PENDING ;

}
```

The completion routine can either return STATUS_CONTINUE_COMPLETION or STATUS_MORE_PROCESSING_REQUIRED. You return STATUS_MORE_PROCESSING_REQUIRED only if you intend to reuse the IRP from another thread and complete it later.

```cpp
NTSTATUS
CompletionRoutine_41(
    IN PDEVICE_OBJECT   DeviceObject,
    IN PIRP             Irp,
    IN PVOID            Context
    )
{ 
    // 
    // By returning STATUS_CONTINUE_COMPLETION , you are relinquishing the 
    // ownership of the IRP. You cannot touch the IRP after this.
    // 
    return STATUS_CONTINUE_COMPLETION ; 
} 


NTSTATUS
CompletionRoutine_42 (
    IN PDEVICE_OBJECT   DeviceObject,
    IN PIRP             Irp,
    IN PVOID            Context
    )
{  
    // 
    // Because you are stopping the completion of the IRP by returning the
    // following status, you must complete the IRP later.
    // 
    return STATUS_MORE_PROCESSING_REQUIRED ; 
}
```

### Scenario 5: Complete the IRP in the dispatch routine

This scenario shows how to complete an IRP in the dispatch routine. 

**Important** When you complete an IRP in the dispatch routine, the return status of the dispatch routine should match the status of the value that is set in the IoStatus block of the IRP (Irp->IoStatus.Status).

```cpp
NTSTATUS
DispatchRoutine_5(
    IN PDEVICE_OBJECT DeviceObject,
    IN PIRP Irp
    )
{
    // 
    // <-- Process the IRP here.
    // 
    Irp->IoStatus.Status = STATUS_XXX;
    Irp->IoStatus.Information = YYY;
    IoCompletRequest(Irp, IO_NO_INCREMENT);
    return STATUS_XXX;
}
```

## Creating IRPs and sending them to another driver

### Introduction

Before you examine the scenarios, you must understand the differences between a driver-created synchronous input/output request packet (IRP) and an asynchronous request. 

|    Synchronous   (Threaded) IRP                                                                                                                        |    Asynchronous   (Non-Threaded) IRP                                                                                                                       |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|    Created by using IoBuildSynchronousFsdRequest   or IoBuildDeviceIoControlRequest .                                                                  |    Created by using IoBuildAsynchronousFsdRequest   or IoAllocateIrp . This is meant for driver to driver   communication.                                 |
|    Thread must wait   for the IRP to complete.                                                                                                         |    Thread does not   have to wait for the IRP to complete.                                                                                                 |
|    Associated with the   thread that created it, hence, the name threaded IRPs. Therefore, if the   thread exits, the I/O manager cancels the IRP.     |    Not associated with   the thread that created it.                                                                                                       |
|    Cannot be created   in an arbitrary thread context.                                                                                                 |    Can be created in   an arbitrary thread context because the thread does not wait for the IRP to   complete.                                             |
|    The I/O manager   does the post completions to free the buffer that is associated with the IRP.                                                     |    The I/O manager   cannot do the cleanup. The driver must provide a completion routine and free   the buffers that are associated with the IRP.          |
|    Must be sent at   IRQL level equal to PASSIVE_LEVEL.                                                                                                |    Can be sent at IRQL   less than or equal to DISPATCH_LEVEL if the Dispatch routine of the target   driver can handle the request at DISPATCH_LEVEL.     |

### Scenario 6: Send a synchronous device-control request (IRP_MJ_INTERNAL_DEVICE_CONTROL/IRP_MJ_DEVICE_CONTROL) by using IoBuildDeviceIoControlRequest

The following code shows how to call [**IoBuildDeviceIoControlRequest**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-iobuilddeviceiocontrolrequest) request to make a synchronous IOCTL request.  For more info, see [IRP_MJ_INTERNAL_DEVICE_CONTROL](irp-mj-internal-device-control.md) and [IRP_MJ_DEVICE_CONTROL](irp-mj-device-control.md).

```cpp
NTSTATUS
MakeSynchronousIoctl(
    IN PDEVICE_OBJECT    TopOfDeviceStack,
    IN ULONG         IoctlControlCode,
    PVOID             InputBuffer,
    ULONG             InputBufferLength,
    PVOID             OutputBuffer,
    ULONG             OutputBufferLength
    )
/*++

Arguments:

    TopOfDeviceStack- 

    IoctlControlCode              - Value of the IOCTL request

    InputBuffer        - Buffer to be sent to the TopOfDeviceStack

    InputBufferLength  - Size of buffer to be sent to the TopOfDeviceStack

    OutputBuffer       - Buffer for received data from the TopOfDeviceStack

    OutputBufferLength - Size of receive buffer from the TopOfDeviceStack

Return Value:

    NT status code

--*/ 
{
    KEVENT              event;
    PIRP                irp;
    IO_STATUS_BLOCK     ioStatus;
    NTSTATUS status;

    // 
    // Creating Device control IRP and send it to the another
    // driver without setting a completion routine.
    // 

    KeInitializeEvent(&event, NotificationEvent, FALSE);

    irp = IoBuildDeviceIoControlRequest (
                            IoctlControlCode,
                            TopOfDeviceStack,
                            InputBuffer,
                            InputBufferLength,
                            OutputBuffer,
                            OutputBufferLength,
                            FALSE, // External
                            &event,
                            &ioStatus);

    if (NULL == irp) {
        return STATUS_INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES;
    }


    status = IoCallDriver(TopOfDeviceStack, irp);

    if (status == STATUS_PENDING) {
        // 
        // You must wait here for the IRP to be completed because:
        // 1) The IoBuildDeviceIoControlRequest associates the IRP with the
        //     thread and if the thread exits for any reason, it would cause the IRP
        //     to be canceled. 
        // 2) The Event and IoStatus block memory is from the stack and we
        //     cannot go out of scope.
        // This event will be signaled by the I/O manager when the
        // IRP is completed.
        // 
        status = KeWaitForSingleObject(
                     &event,
                     Executive, // wait reason
                     KernelMode, // To prevent stack from being paged out.
                     FALSE,     // You are not alertable
                     NULL);     // No time out !!!!

        status = ioStatus.Status;                     
    }

    return status;
}
```

### Scenario 7: Send a synchronous device-control (IOCTL) request and cancel it if not completed in a certain time period 
This scenario is similar to the previous scenario except that instead of waiting indefinitely for the request to complete, it waits for some user-specified time and safely cancels the IOCTL request if the wait times out. 

```cpp
typedef enum {

   IRPLOCK_CANCELABLE,
   IRPLOCK_CANCEL_STARTED,
   IRPLOCK_CANCEL_COMPLETE,
   IRPLOCK_COMPLETED

} IRPLOCK;
// 
// An IRPLOCK allows for safe cancellation. The idea is to protect the IRP
// while the canceller is calling IoCancelIrp. This is done by wrapping the
// call in InterlockedExchange(s). The roles are as follows:
// 
// Initiator/completion: Cancelable --> IoCallDriver() --> Completed
// Canceller: CancelStarted --> IoCancelIrp() --> CancelCompleted
// 
// No cancellation:
//   Cancelable-->Completed
// 
// Cancellation, IoCancelIrp returns before completion:
//   Cancelable --> CancelStarted --> CancelCompleted --> Completed
// 
// Canceled after completion:
//   Cancelable --> Completed -> CancelStarted
// 
// Cancellation, IRP completed during call to IoCancelIrp():
//   Cancelable --> CancelStarted -> Completed --> CancelCompleted
// 
//  The transition from CancelStarted to Completed tells the completer to block
//  postprocessing (IRP ownership is transferred to the canceller). Similarly,
//  the canceller learns it owns IRP postprocessing (free, completion, etc)
//  during a Completed->CancelCompleted transition.
//

MakeSynchronousIoctlWithTimeOut(
    IN PDEVICE_OBJECT    TopOfDeviceStack,
    IN ULONG         IoctlControlCode,
    PVOID             InputBuffer,
    ULONG             InputBufferLength,
    PVOID             OutputBuffer,
    ULONG             OutputBufferLength,
    IN  ULONG               Milliseconds
    )

    OutputBuffer       - Buffer for received data from the TopOfDeviceStack.

    OutputBufferLength - Size of receive buffer from the TopOfDeviceStack.

### Scenario 10: Send an asynchronous request by using IoBuildAsynchronousFsdRequest 
This scenario shows how to make an asynchronous request by calling [**IoBuildAsynchronousFsdRequest**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-iobuildasynchronousfsdrequest). 

In an asynchronous request, the thread that made the request does not have to wait for the IRP to complete. The IRP can be created in an arbitrary thread context because the IRP is not associated with the thread. You must provide a completion routine and release the buffers and IRP in the completion routine if you do not intend to reuse the IRP. This is because the I/O manager cannot do post-completion cleanup of driver-created asynchronous IRPs (created with **IoBuildAsynchronousFsdRequest** and **IoAllocateIrp**). 

```cpp
NTSTATUS
MakeAsynchronousRequest (
    PDEVICE_OBJECT   TopOfDeviceStack,

### Scenario 12: Send an asynchronous request and cancel it in a different thread 
This scenario shows you how you can send one request at a time to a lower driver without waiting for the request to complete, and you can also cancel the request at any time from another thread. 

You can remember the IRP and other variables to do this work in a device extension or in a context structure global to the device as shown below. The state of the IRP is tracked with an IRPLOCK variable in the device extension. The IrpEvent is used to make sure that the IRP is fully completed (or freed) before making the next request. 

This event is also useful when you handle [IRP_MN_REMOVE_DEVICE](irp-mn-remove-device.md) and [IRP_MN_STOP_DEVICE PNP](irp-mn-stop-device.md) requests where you have to make sure that there are no pending IRPs before you complete these requests. This event works best when you initialize it as a synchronization event in AddDevice or in some other initialization routine.

```cpp
typedef struct _DEVICE_EXTENSION{
    ..
    PDEVICE_OBJECT TopOfDeviceStack;
    PIRP PendingIrp; 
    IRPLOCK IrpLock; // You need this to track the state of the IRP.
    KEVENT IrpEvent; // You need this to synchronize various threads.
    ..
} DEVICE_EXTENSION, *PDEVICE_EXTENSION;
