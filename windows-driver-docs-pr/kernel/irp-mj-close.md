# IRP\_MJ\_CLOSE


Every driver must handle close requests in a [*DispatchClose*](separate-dispatchcreate-and-dispatchclose-routines.md) routine, with the possible exception of a driver whose device cannot be disabled or removed from the machine without bringing down the system. A disk driver whose device holds the system page file is an example of such a driver. Note that the driver of such a device also cannot be unloaded dynamically.

## When Sent

Receipt of this request indicates that the last handle of the file object that is associated with the target device object has been closed and released. All outstanding I/O requests have been completed or canceled.

## Input Parameters


None

## Output Parameters


None

## Operation

Many device and intermediate drivers merely set STATUS\_SUCCESS in the I/O status block of the IRP and complete the close request. However, what a given driver does on receipt of a close request depends on the driver's design. In general, a driver should undo whatever actions it takes on receipt of the [**IRP\_MJ\_CREATE**](irp-mj-create.md) request. Device drivers whose device objects are exclusive, such as a serial driver, also can reset the hardware on receipt of a close request.

The **IRP\_MJ\_CLOSE** request is not necessarily sent in the context of the process that closed the file object handle. If the driver must release process-specific resources, such as user memory, that the driver previously locked or mapped, it must do so in response to an [**IRP\_MJ\_CLEANUP**](irp-mj-cleanup.md) request.

The **IRP\_MJ\_CLOSE** request will always be sent at PASSIVE\_LEVEL.
