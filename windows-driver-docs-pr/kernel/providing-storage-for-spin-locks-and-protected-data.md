# Providing Storage for Spin Locks and Protected Data





As part of device start-up, a driver must allocate resident storage for any spin-lock-protected data or resources and for corresponding spin locks in one of the following places:

-   The device extension of a device object that the driver sets up by calling [**IoCreateDevice**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-iocreatedevice)

-   The controller extension of a controller object that the driver sets up by calling [**IoCreateController**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ntddk/nf-ntddk-iocreatecontroller)

-   Nonpaged, system-space memory that the driver obtains by calling [**ExAllocatePoolWithTag**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-exallocatepoolwithtag)

Attempting to access pageable data while holding a spin lock causes a fatal page fault if that page is not present. Referencing a spin lock that is invalid (because it was stored in pageable memory and is currently paged out) also causes a fatal page fault.

A driver must provide the storage for each of the following kinds of executive spin lock it might use:

- Any spin lock that the driver explicitly acquires and releases using any of the **Ke*Xxx*** spin lock routines.

- Any spin lock used as a parameter to any of the **ExInterlocked*Xxx*** routines.

While a driver can make calls to the **ExInterlocked*Xxx*** routines from its ISR or [*SynchCritSection*](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nc-wdm-ksynchronize_routine) routines, it cannot use any of the **Ke*Xxx*** routines to acquire and release spin locks at any IRQL greater than DISPATCH\_LEVEL. Consequently, any driver that reuses a spin lock between calls to the **Ke*Xxx*SpinLock** and **ExInterlocked*Xxx*** routines must make every call while running at IRQL &lt;= DISPATCH\_LEVEL.

A driver can pass the same spin lock to **ExInterlockedInsertHeadList** as it does to another **ExInterlocked*Xxx*** routine, as long as both routines use the spin lock at the same IRQL. For more information about how spin lock usage affects performance, see [Using Spin Locks: An Example](using-spin-locks--an-example.md).

In addition to the storage for its executive spin locks, a device driver must provide the storage for another spin lock to be associated with its interrupt objects if it has a multivector ISR or more than one ISR.
