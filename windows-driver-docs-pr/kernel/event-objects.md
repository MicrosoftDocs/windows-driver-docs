# Event Objects





A driver can use an event object to wait while the next-lower driver processes an IRP set up by the waiting driver. Drivers that have driver-created threads or driver dispatch routines that wait for the completion of a synchronous I/O request also can use an event object to synchronize operations between their threads and/or other driver routines.

This section contains the following topics:
