# AddDevice Routines in Bus Drivers





A PnP bus driver has an *AddDevice* routine, but it is called when the bus driver is acting as the function driver for its controller or adapter. For example, the PnP manager calls the USB Hub bus driver's *AddDevice* routine to add the hub device. The hub driver's *AddDevice* routine is not called for a child of the hub (a device that plugs into the hub).
