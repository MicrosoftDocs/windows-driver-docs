# Stopping a Device





The PnP manager directs drivers to stop a device in the following situations:

-   To rebalance the hardware resources being used by the device. Rebalancing is typically necessary when a new device is enumerated that requires a resource already in use.

-   To disable the device in response to a Device Manager request (Windows 98/Me only). Windows 2000 and later versions of Windows send remove IRPs in this situation; see [Understanding When Remove IRPs Are Issued](understanding-when-remove-irps-are-issued.md).

-   After a failed [**IRP\_MN\_START\_DEVICE**](./irp-mn-start-device.md) request (Windows 98/Me only)
