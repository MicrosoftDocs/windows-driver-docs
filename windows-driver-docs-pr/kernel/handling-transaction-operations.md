# Handling Transaction Operations


Resource managers must handle three transaction operations: *commit*, *rollback*, and *recovery*.

To *commit a transaction*, a resource manager makes all changes to a transaction's data permanent and visible to other transactions.

To *roll back a transaction*, a resource manager removes all changes to a transaction's data. The resource manager must restore the data to the state that it was in before the transaction was created.

To *recover a transaction*, a resource manager restores a transaction's data to a known good state after a system crash or another unexpected event.
