# Why Thunking Is Necessary

Kernel-mode drivers must validate the size of any I/O buffer passed in from a user-mode application. If a 32-bit application passes a buffer containing pointer-precision data types to a 64-bit driver, and no thunking takes place, the driver will expect the buffer to be larger than it actually is. This is because pointer precision is 32 bits on 32-bit Microsoft Windows and 64 bits on 64-bit Windows. For example, consider the following structure definition:

```cpp
typedef struct _DRIVER_DATA
{
    HANDLE           Event;
    UNICODE_STRING   ObjectName;
} DRIVER_DATA;
```

On 32-bit Windows, the size of the DRIVER\_DATA structure is 12 bytes. This table shows the sizes of the **Event** member and **ObjectName** members of the DRIVER_DATA structure:

|Event|ObjectName (USHORT Length)|ObjectName (USHORT Maximum Length)|ObjectName (PWSTR Buffer)|
|----|----|----|---|
|32 bits|16 bits|16 bits|32 bits|
|(4 bytes)|(2 bytes)|(2 bytes)|(4 bytes)|

On 64-bit Windows, the size of the DRIVER\_DATA structure is 24 bytes. (The 4 bytes of structure padding are required so that the **Buffer** member can be aligned on an 8-byte boundary.)

|Event|ObjectName (USHORT Length)|ObjectName (USHORT Maximum Length)|Empty (Structure Padding)|ObjectName (PWSTR Buffer)|
|----|----|----|----|----|
|64 bits|16 bits|16 bits|32 bits|64 bits|
|(8 bytes)|(2 bytes)|(2 bytes)|(4 bytes)|(8 bytes)|

If a 64-bit driver receives 12 bytes of DRIVER\_DATA when it expected 24 bytes, the size validation will fail. To prevent this, the driver must detect whether a DRIVER\_DATA structure was sent by a 32-bit application, and if so, thunk it appropriately before performing the validation.

For example, a thunked version of the above DRIVER\_DATA structure could be defined as follows:

```cpp
typedef struct _DRIVER_DATA32
{
    VOID *POINTER_32   Event;
    UNICODE_STRING32   ObjectName;
} DRIVER_DATA32;
```

Because it contains only fixed-precision data types, this new structure is the same size on 32-bit Windows and 64-bit Windows.

|Event|ObjectName (USHORT Length)|ObjectName (USHORT Maximum Length)|ULONG Buffer|
|----|----|----|----|
|32 bits|16 bits|16 bits|32 bits|
|(4 bytes)|(2 bytes)|(2 bytes)|(4 bytes)|
