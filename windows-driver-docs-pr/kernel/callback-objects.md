# Callback Objects





The kernel's callback mechanism provides a general way for drivers to request and provide notification when certain conditions are satisfied.

A driver can create a callback object, and other drivers can request notification for conditions associated with this driver-defined callback. In addition, the system defines three callback objects for driver use.

Every callback object has a name and a set of attributes, defined when the object is created. The system-defined callback objects are named **\\Callback\\SetSystemTime**, **\\Callback\\PowerState**, and **\\Callback\\ProcessorAdd**; driver-defined callbacks must not duplicate these names.

To request notification from a system- or driver-defined callback, a driver opens the callback object and registers a callback routine. When the conditions defined for the callback become true, its creator triggers notification. In turn, the system calls all the callback routines registered for the callback.
