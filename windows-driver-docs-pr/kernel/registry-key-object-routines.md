# Registry Key Object Routines





The Windows executive represents registry keys as executive objects that are managed by the object manager. (For more information about the object manager, see [Object Management](managing-kernel-objects.md).) In particular, every key has an object name, and you can open a handle to a key.

User-mode applications access keys relative to global handles, such as HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE or HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER. However, these handles are not available to kernel-mode code. Instead, you refer to a key by its object name. The root for all registry keys is the **\\Registry** object. The global handles correspond to descendants of the **\\Registry** object, as shown in the following table.

<table>

<tr class="odd">

<tr class="odd">

<tr class="even">
<td><p>HKEY_CURRENT_USER</p></td>

A driver can manipulate a registry-key object by performing the following steps:

1.  Open a handle to the registry-key object. For more information, see [Opening a Handle to a Registry-Key Object](opening-a-handle-to-a-registry-key-object.md).

2.  Perform the intended operations by calling the appropriate **Zw*Xxx*Key** routines. For information about how to do so, see [Using a Handle to a Registry-Key Object](using-a-handle-to-a-registry-key-object.md).

3.  Close the handle by calling [**ZwClose**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ntifs/nf-ntifs-ntclose).
