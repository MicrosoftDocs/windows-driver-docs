# Failing a System Query-Power IRP in a Filter or Function Driver





A filter or function driver (that is not the power policy owner for a device) can fail an [**IRP\_MN\_QUERY\_POWER**](./irp-mn-query-power.md) request if either of the following is true:

-   The device is enabled for wake-up and the requested system power state is less powered than the value of [**SystemWake**](systemwake.md), which specifies the least-powered state from which the device can wake the system. For example, a device that can wake the system from S2 but not from S3 would fail a query for S3 but succeed a query for S2.

-   Entering a device power state that corresponds to the requested state would force the driver to abandon an operation that would lose data, such as an open modem connection. A driver rarely will fail a query for this reason; under most circumstances, the application handles such cases.

To fail an **IRP\_MN\_QUERY\_POWER** request for a system power state, a driver should take the following steps:

1.  Call [**PoStartNextPowerIrp**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ntifs/nf-ntifs-postartnextpowerirp) to indicate that the driver is prepared to handle the next power IRP. (Windows Server 2003, Windows XP, and Windows 2000 only)

2.  Set **Irp-&gt;IoStatus.Status** to a failure status and call [**IoCompleteRequest**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-iocompleterequest), specifying IO\_NO\_INCREMENT. Do not pass the IRP further down the device stack.

3.  Call [**IoReleaseRemoveLock**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-ioreleaseremovelock) to release the previously acquired lock.

4.  Return a failure status from its [*DispatchPower*](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nc-wdm-driver_dispatch) routine.
