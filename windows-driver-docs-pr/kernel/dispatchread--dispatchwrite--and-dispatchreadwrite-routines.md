# DispatchRead, DispatchWrite, and DispatchReadWrite Routines





A driver's [*DispatchRead*](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nc-wdm-driver_dispatch) and [*DispatchWrite*](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nc-wdm-driver_dispatch) routines handle IRPs with I/O function codes of [**IRP\_MJ\_READ**](./irp-mj-read.md) and [**IRP\_MJ\_WRITE**](./irp-mj-write.md), respectively. Alternatively, a combined [*DispatchReadWrite*](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nc-wdm-driver_dispatch) routine can handle IRPs for both of these I/O function codes.

Every driver of a device from which data can be transferred to the system must have a *DispatchRead* routine. Every driver of a device to which data can be transferred from the system must have a *DispatchWrite* routine. Any driver that transfers data in both directions can have a combined *DispatchReadWrite* routine.

Lower-level drivers handle **IRP\_MJ\_READ** and **IRP\_MJ\_WRITE** requests asynchronously. Therefore, *DispatchRead* and/or *DispatchWrite* routines in highest-level drivers must pass these requests on for further processing, provided that the request has valid parameters in that driver's I/O stack location of the IRP.

Whether a driver sets up its device objects for buffered or direct I/O affects how it handles transfer requests. In particular, a driver that uses direct I/O to do DMA operations might need to split up large transfer requests into a sequence of smaller transfer operations in order to satisfy an **IRP\_MJ\_READ** or **IRP\_MJ\_WRITE** request. For more information, see [Input/Output Techniques](i-o-programming-techniques.md).

The following subsections discuss some of the design and implementation considerations for *DispatchReadWrite* routines in lowest-level device drivers that use buffered I/O and direct I/O, as well as in higher-level drivers layered above them:
