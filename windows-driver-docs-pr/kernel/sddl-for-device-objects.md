# SDDL for Device Objects





The Security Descriptor Definition Language (SDDL) is used to represent security descriptors. Security for device objects can be specified by an SDDL string that is [placed in an INF file](../install/creating-secure-device-installations.md) or passed to [**IoCreateDeviceSecure**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdmsec/nf-wdmsec-wdmlibiocreatedevicesecure). The [Security Descriptor Definition Language](/windows/desktop/SecAuthZ/security-descriptor-definition-language) is fully documented in the Microsoft Windows SDK documentation.

While INF files support the full range of SDDL, only a subset of the language is supported by the **IoCreateDeviceSecure** routine. This subset is defined here.

SDDL strings for device objects are of the form "D:P" followed by one or more expressions of the form "(A;;*Access*;;;*SID*)". The *SID* value specifies a security identifier that determines to whom the *Access* value applies (for example, a user or group). The *Access* value specifies the access rights allowed for the SID. The *Access* and *SID* values are as follows.

**Note**  When using SDDL for device objects, your driver must link against Wdmsec.lib.

 

<a href="" id="access"></a>*Access*  
Specifies an [**ACCESS\_MASK**](access-mask.md) value that determines the allowed access. This value can be written either as a hexadecimal value in the form "0x*hex*", or as a sequence of two-letter symbolic codes that represent access rights.

The following codes can be used to specify generic access rights.

<table>
<colgroup>
<col width="50%" />
<col width="50%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Code</th>
<th>Generic access right</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>

<td><p>GENERIC_WRITE</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>GX</p></td>
<td><p>GENERIC_EXECUTE</p></td>

</tbody>
</table>

 

The following codes can be used to specify specific access rights.

Note that GENERIC\_ALL grants all the rights listed in the above two tables, including the ability to change the ACL.

Access is granted only if a token passes both tests. As such, RC actually works in combination with other SIDs.</p>
<p>Any ACL that specifies RC must also specify WD. When RC is paired with WD in an ACL, a superset of Everyone including untrusted code is described.</p>
<p>Untrusted code might be code launched using the Run As option in Explorer. By default, World does not cover untrusted code.</p></td>

<p>In earlier versions of Windows, which do not recognize the "UD" abbreviation, you must specify the fully qualified form of this SID (S-1-5-84-0-0-0-0-0) to grant access to UMDF drivers.

### SDDL Examples For Device Objects

This section describes the predefined SDDL strings found in Wdmsec.h. You can also use these as templates to define new SDDL strings for device objects.

SDDL\_DEVOBJ\_KERNEL\_ONLY

**"D:P"**

SDDL\_DEVOBJ\_KERNEL\_ONLY is the "empty" ACL. User-mode code (including processes running as system) cannot open the device.

A PnP bus driver could use this descriptor when creating a PDO. The INF file could then specify looser security settings for the device. By specifying this descriptor, the bus driver would ensure that no attempt to open the device before the INF was processed would succeed.

Similarly, a non-WDM driver could use this descriptor to make its device objects inaccessible until the appropriate user-mode program (such as an installer) sets the final security descriptor in the registry.

In all of these cases, the default is tight security, loosened as necessary.

SDDL\_DEVOBJ\_SYS\_ALL

**"D:P(A;;GA;;;SY)"**

SDDL\_DEVOBJ\_SYS\_ALL is similar to SDDL\_DEVOBJ\_KERNEL\_ONLY, except that in addition to kernel-mode code, user-mode code running as System is also allowed to open the device for any access.

A legacy driver might use this ACL to start with tight security settings, and let its service open the device up at run time to individual users by using the **SetFileSecurity** user-mode function. In this case, the service would have to be running as System.

SDDL\_DEVOBJ\_SYS\_ALL\_ADM\_ALL

**"D:P(A;;GA;;;SY)(A;;GA;;;BA)"**

SDDL\_DEVOBJ\_SYS\_ALL\_ADM\_ALL allows the kernel, system, and administrator complete control over the device. No other users may access the device.

SDDL\_DEVOBJ\_SYS\_ALL\_ADM\_RWX\_WORLD\_R

**"D:P(A;;GA;;;SY)(A;;GRGWGX;;;BA)(A;;GR;;;WD)"**

SDDL\_DEVOBJ\_SYS\_ALL\_ADM\_RWX\_WORLD\_R allows the kernel and system complete control over the device. By default the administrator can access the entire device, but cannot change the ACL (the administrator must take control of the device first.)

Everyone (the World SID) is given read access. Untrusted code cannot access the device (untrusted code might be code launched using the Run As option in Explorer. By default, World does not cover Restricted code.)

Also note that traversal access is not granted to normal users. As such, this might not be an appropriate descriptor for a device with a namespace.

SDDL\_DEVOBJ\_SYS\_ALL\_ADM\_RWX\_WORLD\_R\_RES\_R

**"D:P(A;;GA;;;SY)(A;;GRGWGX;;;BA)(A;;GR;;;WD)(A;;GR;;;RC)"**

SDDL\_DEVOBJ\_SYS\_ALL\_ADM\_RWX\_WORLD\_R\_RES\_R allows the kernel and system complete control over the device. By default the administrator can access the entire device, but cannot change the ACL (the administrator must take control of the device first.)

Everyone (the World SID) is given read access. In addition, untrusted code is also allowed to access code. Untrusted code might be code launched using the Run As option in Explorer. By default, World does not cover Restricted code.

Also note that traversal access is not granted to normal users. As such, this might not be an appropriate descriptor for a device with a namespace.

 

Note that the above SDDL strings do not include any inheritance modifiers. As such, they are only appropriate for device objects and should not be used for files or registry keys. For more information about specifying inheritance using SDDL, see the Microsoft Windows SDK documentation.
