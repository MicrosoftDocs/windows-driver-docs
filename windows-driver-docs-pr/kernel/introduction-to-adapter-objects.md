# Introduction to Adapter Objects





Any driver that uses direct I/O and DMA must create an adapter object. The adapter object represents either a DMA controller channel or port, or a bus-master device.

Two kinds of lowest-level drivers must use adapter objects:

-   Drivers for devices that use the system DMA controller. Such devices are called *subordinate devices* and are said to "use system (or *subordinate*) DMA."

-   Drivers for devices that are bus-master adapters. Such devices arbitrate with the system for use of the I/O bus, and thus use bus-master DMA.

Drivers provide storage, usually in a device extension, for a pointer to the adapter object.

To carry out DMA transfers, drivers of devices that use either of these DMA methods usually have an [*AdapterControl*](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nc-wdm-driver_control) routine and call system-supplied support routines that manipulate adapter objects. (Drivers that do not require *AdapterControl* routines include those that [use scatter/gather DMA](using-scatter-gather-dma.md) and those that [use common-buffer, bus-master DMA](using-common-buffer-bus-master-dma.md).)

As part of device start-up operations, drivers that handle DMA operations call the I/O manager, which in turn calls the platform-specific HAL to create a set of adapter objects. On any Windows platform, the set of adapter objects usually includes an adapter object for:

-   Each system DMA controller channel or port to which a subordinate device is attached.

-   Each bus-master DMA device in the machine.

(For SCSI devices capable of bus-master DMA, the SCSI port driver sets up adapter objects for HBA-specific SCSI miniport drivers. The miniport driver's [*HwScsiFindAdapter*](/previous-versions/windows/hardware/drivers/ff557300(v=vs.85)) routine supplies the port driver with adapter-specific data.)

See this section as well as [Using Bus-Master DMA](using-bus-master-dma.md) for more information about when and how drivers use adapter objects and *AdapterControl* routines.
