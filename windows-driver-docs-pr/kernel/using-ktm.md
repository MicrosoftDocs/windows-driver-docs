# Using KTM


You can use the Kernel Transaction Manager (KTM) and the [Common Log File System](using-common-log-file-system.md) (CLFS) to create a [*transaction processing system*](transaction-processing-terms.md#ktm-term-transaction-processing-system) (TPS).

This section includes the following topics:
