# Using the CONNECT\_LINE\_BASED Version of IoConnectInterruptEx


For Windows Vista and later operating systems, a driver can use the CONNECT\_LINE\_BASED version of [**IoConnectInterruptEx**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-ioconnectinterruptex) to register an [*InterruptService*](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nc-wdm-kservice_routine) routine for the driver's line-based interrupts. (Driver for earlier operating systems can use the CONNECT\_FULLY\_SPECIFIED version of **IoConnectInterruptEx**.)

**Note**   You can use this method only for drivers that register a single interrupt service routine (ISR) for all of its line-based interrupts. If the driver can receive multiple interrupts, it must use the CONNECT\_FULLY\_SPECIFIED version of **IoConnectInterruptEx**.

 

The driver specifies a value of CONNECT\_LINE\_BASED for *Parameters*-&gt;**Version** and uses the members of *Parameters*-&gt;**LineBased** to specify the other parameters of the operation:

-   *Parameters*-&gt;**LineBased.PhysicalDeviceObject** specifies the physical device object (PDO) for the device that the ISR services. The system uses the device object to automatically identify the device's line-based interrupts.

-   *Parameters*-&gt;**LineBased.ServiceRoutine** points to the *InterruptService* routine, while *Parameters*-&gt;**LineBased**.**ServiceContext** specifies the value that the system passes as the *ServiceContext* parameter to *InterruptService*. The driver can use this to pass context information. For more information about passing context information, see [Providing ISR Context Information](providing-isr-context-information.md).

-   The driver provides a pointer to a PKINTERRUPT variable in *Parameters***-&gt;LineBased.InterruptObject**. **IoConnectInterruptEx** sets this variable to point to the interrupt object for the interrupt, which can be used when removing the ISR. For more information, see [Removing an ISR](removing-an-isr.md).

-   Drivers can optionally specify a spin lock in *Parameters***-&gt;LineBased.SpinLock** for the system to use when synchronizing with the ISR. Most drivers can just specify **NULL** to enable the system to allocate a spin lock on behalf of the driver. For more information about synchronizing with an ISR, see [Synchronizing Access to Device Data](synchronizing-access-to-device-data.md).

The following code example demonstrates how to register an *InterruptService* routine using CONNECT\_LINE\_BASED:

```cpp
IO_CONNECT_INTERRUPT_PARAMETERS params;

// deviceExtension is a pointer to the driver's device extension. 
//     deviceExtension->IntObj is a PKINTERRUPT.
// deviceInterruptService is a pointer to the driver's InterruptService routine.
// PhysicalDeviceObject is a pointer to the device's PDO. 
// ServiceContext is a pointer to driver-specified context for the ISR.

RtlZeroMemory( &params, sizeof(IO_CONNECT_INTERRUPT_PARAMETERS) );
params.Version = CONNECT_LINE_BASED;
params.LineBased.PhysicalDeviceObject = PhysicalDeviceObject;
params.LineBased.InterruptObject = &deviceExtension->IntObj;
params.LineBased.ServiceRoutine = deviceInterruptService;
params.LineBased.ServiceContext = ServiceContext;
params.LineBased.SpinLock = NULL;
params.LineBased.SynchronizeIrql = 0;
params.LineBased.FloatingSave = FALSE;

status = IoConnectInterruptEx(&params);

if (!NT_SUCCESS(status)) {
    // Operation failed. Handle error.
    ...
}
```
