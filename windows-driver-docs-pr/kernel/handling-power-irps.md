# Handling Power IRPs





Drivers handle power IRPs in a [*DispatchPower*](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nc-wdm-driver_dispatch) routine. All power management requests have the major IRP code [**IRP\_MJ\_POWER**](./irp-mj-power.md) and one of the following minor codes:

[**IRP\_MN\_QUERY\_POWER**](./irp-mn-query-power.md) — Queries to determine whether changing power state is feasible

[**IRP\_MN\_SET\_POWER**](./irp-mn-set-power.md) — Requests a change from one power state to another

[**IRP\_MN\_WAIT\_WAKE**](./irp-mn-wait-wake.md) — Requests that a device be enabled to wake itself or the system

[**IRP\_MN\_POWER\_SEQUENCE**](./irp-mn-power-sequence.md) — Requests information to optimize power restoration to a particular device

Support for **IRP\_MN\_SET\_POWER** and **IRP\_MN\_QUERY\_POWER** is required. All drivers must be prepared to handle these IRPs.

Support for **IRP\_MN\_WAIT\_WAKE** is required for all drivers in the device stack for any device that can awaken in response to an external signal. A driver sends this IRP to enable the device for wake-up.

Support for **IRP\_MN\_POWER\_SEQUENCE** is optional. This IRP provides an optimization for devices that take a long time to restore power.

A power IRP can specify a system power operation or a device power operation. [Power IRPs for the system](power-irps-for-the-system.md) and [power IRPs for individual devices](power-irps-for-individual-devices.md) take slightly different paths through a device stack, as explained in the following sections.
