# IRP\_MN\_ENABLE\_COLLECTION


Any WMI driver that registers one or more of its data blocks as potentially time-consuming, or *expensive*, to collect must handle this IRP. A driver can handle WMI IRPs either by calling [**WmiSystemControl**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff565834) or by handling the IRP itself, as described in [Handling WMI Requests](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff546968).

If a driver calls [**WmiSystemControl**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff565834) to handle an **IRP\_MN\_ENABLE\_COLLECTION** request, WMI in turn calls that driver's [*DpWmiFunctionControl*](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff544094) routine.

Major Code
----------

[**IRP\_MJ\_SYSTEM\_CONTROL**](irp-mj-system-control.md)
When Sent
---------

WMI sends this IRP to request the driver to start accumulating data for a data block that the driver registered as expensive to collect.

WMI sends this IRP at IRQL = PASSIVE\_LEVEL in an arbitrary thread context.

## Input Parameters


**Parameters.WMI.ProviderId** points to the device object of the driver that should respond to the request. This pointer is located in the driver's I/O stack location in the IRP.

**Parameters.WMI.DataPath** points to a GUID that identifies the data block for which data is accumulated.

## Output Parameters


None.

## I/O Status Block


If the driver handles the IRP by calling [**WmiSystemControl**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff565834), WMI sets **Irp-&gt;IoStatus.Status** and **Irp-&gt;IoStatus.Information** in the I/O status block.

Otherwise, the driver sets **Irp-&gt;IoStatus.Status** to STATUS\_SUCCESS or to an appropriate error status such as the following:

STATUS\_WMI\_GUID\_NOT\_FOUND

STATUS\_INVALID\_DEVICE\_REQUEST

On success, a driver sets **Irp-&gt;IoStatus.Information** to zero.

Operation
---------

A driver registers a data block as expensive to collect by setting WMIREG\_FLAG\_EXPENSIVE in the **Flags** member of the [**WMIREGGUID**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff565827) or [**WMIGUIDREGINFO**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff565811) structure. The driver passes these structures to WMI when it registers or updates the data block. A driver need not accumulate data for such a block until it receives an explicit request to start data collection.

A driver can handle WMI IRPs either by calling [**WmiSystemControl**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff565834) or by handling the IRP itself, as described in [Handling WMI Requests](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff546968).

If a driver handles WMI IRPs by calling [**WmiSystemControl**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff565834), that routine calls the driver's [*DpWmiFunctionControl*](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff544094) routine, or returns STATUS\_SUCCESS if the driver does not define the routine.

If a driver handles an **IRP\_MN\_ENABLE\_COLLECTION** request itself, it should do so only if **Parameters.WMI.ProviderId** points to the same device object as the pointer that the driver passed to [**IoWMIRegistrationControl**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff550480). Otherwise, the driver must forward the request to the next-lower driver.

Before handling a request, the driver should make sure that **Parameters.WMI.DataPath** points to a GUID that the driver supports. If it does not, the driver should fail the IRP and return STATUS\_WMI\_GUID\_NOT\_FOUND. If the data block is valid but was not registered with WMIREG\_FLAG\_EXPENSIVE, the driver can return STATUS\_SUCCESS and take no further action.

If the block is valid and was registered with WMIREG\_FLAG\_EXPENSIVE, the driver enables data collection for all instances of that data block.

It is unnecessary for the driver to check whether data collection is already enabled for the data block. WMI sends only a single request to enable a data block after the first data consumer enables the block. WMI will not send another request to enable without an intervening disable request.
