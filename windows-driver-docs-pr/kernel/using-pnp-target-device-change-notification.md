# Using PnP Target Device Change Notification

A driver registers for **EventCategoryTargetDeviceChange** notification on a device so the driver can be notified when the device is about to be removed. For example, if a driver opens a handle to a device, the driver should register for **EventCategoryTargetDeviceChange** notification on the device so the driver can close its handle when the PnP manager needs to remove the device.

Drivers can also use **EventCategoryTargetDeviceChange** notification for custom notification. (See [Using PnP Custom Notification](using-pnp-custom-notification.md).)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Registering for PnP target device change notifications is not intended to notify listeners about target device power state changes. If a driver needs to know about a target device power change, the driver should instead define a power relation between devices. 
>
> To define a power relation, the driver calls [**IoInvalidateDeviceRelations**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-ioinvalidatedevicerelations) with the *Type* parameter set to **PowerRelations**, then responds to the PnP manager's [IRP_MN_QUERY_DEVICE_RELATIONS](irp-mn-query-device-relations.md) query for **PowerRelations** with the correct information.

The following subsections discuss how to register for target device change notification and how to handle target device change events in a PnP notification callback routine:
