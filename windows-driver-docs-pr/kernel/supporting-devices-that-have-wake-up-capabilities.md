# Supporting Devices that Have Wake-Up Capabilities





Drivers for devices that can respond to external wake signals must be able to handle [**IRP\_MN\_WAIT\_WAKE**](./irp-mn-wait-wake.md) requests (*wait/wake IRPs*). The power policy owner for such a device must be able to send an **IRP\_MN\_WAIT\_WAKE** request.

Typically, whatever causes the device to assert the wake signal is also a normal service event for the device. For example, user input, which might cause a keyboard to wake up the system, is a normal event for the keyboard and its drivers.

The first topic of this section, [Overview of Wait/Wake Operation](overview-of-wait-wake-operation.md), contains information useful in writing any driver. The following additional topics provide detailed information about handling and sending wait/wake IRPs:

[Receiving a Wait/Wake IRP](receiving-a-wait-wake-irp.md)

[Sending a Wait/Wake IRP](sending-a-wait-wake-irp.md)

[Canceling a Wait/Wake IRP](canceling-a-wait-wake-irp.md)
