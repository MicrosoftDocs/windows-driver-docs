# IRP\_MJ\_SHUTDOWN


Drivers of mass-storage devices that have internal caches for data must handle this request in a [*DispatchShutdown*](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nc-wdm-driver_dispatch) routine. Drivers of mass-storage devices and intermediate drivers layered over them also must handle this request if an underlying driver maintains internal buffers for data.

## When Sent

Receipt of a shutdown request indicates that a file system driver is sending notice that the system is being shut down.

One or more file system drivers can send such a lower-level driver more than one shutdown request when a user logs off or when the system is being shut down for some other reason.

The PnP manager sends this IRP at IRQL<=APC_LEVEL in an arbitrary thread context.

## Input Parameters


None

## Output Parameters


None

## Operation

The driver must complete the transfer of any data currently cached in the device or held in the driver's internal buffers before completing the shutdown request.

A driver does not receive an **IRP\_MJ\_SHUTDOWN** request for a device object unless it registers to do so with either [**IoRegisterShutdownNotification**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-ioregistershutdownnotification) or [**IoRegisterLastChanceShutdownNotification**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-ioregisterlastchanceshutdownnotification).
