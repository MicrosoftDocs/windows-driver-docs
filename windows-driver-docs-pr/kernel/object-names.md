# Object Names





Kernel-mode objects are either named or unnamed. The *object name* is a Unicode string that both user-mode and kernel-mode components can use to refer to the object. For example, **\\KernelObjects\\LowMemoryCondition** is the name of the standard event object that signals when the amount of free memory in the system is low.

Both user-mode and kernel-mode components use the object name to open a handle to an object. All subsequent operations are performed by using the handle.

If an object is unnamed, a user-mode component cannot open a handle to it. Kernel-mode components can refer to an unnamed object by either a pointer or a handle.

Named objects are organized into a hierarchy. Each object is named relative to a parent object. Each component of the object's name begins with a backslash character. For example, **\\KernelObjects** is the parent object for **\\KernelObjects\\LowMemoryCondition**.

Only some types of objects can have child objects. The following are some examples:

-   Object directories have child objects. The object manager uses object directories to organize objects. For example **\\KernelObjects** is an object directory that holds standard event objects. Object directories do not correspond to actual directories on a disk. For more information, see [Object Directories](object-directories.md).

-   Device objects for disk drives have child objects that correspond to files on the disk.

-   File objects that represent directories have child objects corresponding to files within the directory.

-   Device objects for WDM drivers have their own namespace that can be used in a driver-defined fashion. For more information, see [Controlling Device Namespace Access](controlling-device-namespace-access.md).

Files have object names that are relative to **\\DosDevices**. For example, the file C:\\Directory\\File can be specified as **\\DosDevices\\C:\\**<em>Directory\\File</em>.

For example, the components of the object name can be described as follows.

<tr class="even">
 <td><p><strong>\DosDevices\C:\</strong><em>Directory</em>\<em>File</em></p></td>
<td><p>File object representing the file named C:\Directory\File.</p></td>

Drivers that create named objects do so in specific object directories. For more information, see [Object Directories](object-directories.md).
