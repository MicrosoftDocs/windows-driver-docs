# Industry Initiatives for Power Management


## <a href="" id="ddk-industry-initiatives-for-power-management-kg"></a>


The OnNow initiative defines hardware and software support required for power management.

The *Advanced Configuration and Power Interface Specification*, part of the OnNow initiative, defines a hardware-level interface that enables operating systems to implement power management in a consistent, platform-independent way.

A *Device Class Power Management Reference Specification* is available for each common device class, such as audio or communications devices. Each of these specifications defines power management requirements for a class of device. Driver writers should refer to these specifications, available through the [ACPI / Power Management](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=57185) website, for device-specific details.
