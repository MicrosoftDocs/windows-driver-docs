# Power Manager





The power manager is responsible for managing power usage for the system. It administers the system-wide power policy and tracks the path of power IRPs through the system.

The power manager requests power operations by sending [**IRP\_MJ\_POWER**](./irp-mj-power.md) requests to drivers. A request can specify a new power state or can query whether a change in power state is feasible.

When sleep, hibernation, or shutdown is required, the power manager requests the appropriate power action by sending an **IRP\_MJ\_POWER** request to each leaf node in the device tree. The power manager considers the following in determining whether the system should sleep, hibernate, or shut down:

-   System activity level

-   System battery level

-   Shutdown, hibernate, or sleep requests from applications

-   User actions, such as pressing the power button

-   Control panel settings
