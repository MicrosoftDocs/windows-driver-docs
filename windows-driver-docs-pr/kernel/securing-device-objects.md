# Securing Device Objects


## <a href="" id="ddk-securing-device-objects-kg"></a>


This section documents how to secure a driver's device objects from unauthorized access. It contains the following sections:

[Controlling Device Access](controlling-device-access.md)

[Controlling Device Namespace Access](controlling-device-namespace-access.md)

[SDDL for Device Objects](sddl-for-device-objects.md)

There are two aspects of a device object that must be secured:

-   Access to the device itself. This is documented in [Controlling Device Access](controlling-device-access.md).

-   Access to the device's namespace. This is documented in [Controlling Device Namespace Access](controlling-device-namespace-access.md).
