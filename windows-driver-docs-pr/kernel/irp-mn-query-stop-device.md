# IRP\_MN\_QUERY\_STOP\_DEVICE


All PnP drivers must handle this IRP.

## Value

0x05

## Major Code

[**IRP\_MJ\_PNP**](irp-mj-pnp.md)

## When Sent

The PnP manager sends this IRP to query whether a device can be stopped to rebalance resources.

On Windows 98/Me, the PnP manager also sends this IRP when a device is being disabled.

The PnP manager sends this IRP at IRQL PASSIVE\_LEVEL in the context of a system thread.

## Input Parameters


None

## Output Parameters


None

## I/O Status Block


A driver sets **Irp-&gt;IoStatus.Status** to STATUS\_SUCCESS or to an appropriate error status. If a driver cannot stop the device, the driver sets **Irp-&gt;IoStatus.Status** to STATUS\_UNSUCCESSFUL.

A bus driver can set **Irp-&gt;IoStatus.Status** to STATUS\_RESOURCE\_REQUIREMENTS\_CHANGED to indicate success for the IRP but also to request that the PnP manager requery the resource requirements for the device before sending the stop IRP.

## Operation

This IRP is handled first by the driver at the top of the device stack and then passed down to each lower driver in the stack.

In response to this IRP, the driver indicates whether it is safe to stop the device for resource rebalancing.

See [Plug and Play](./introduction-to-plug-and-play.md) for the general rules for handling [Plug and Play Minor IRPs](plug-and-play-minor-irps.md).

**Sending This IRP**

Reserved for system use. Drivers must not send this IRP.
