# System Shutdown State S5


System power state S5 is the shutdown or off state. Similar to a system in a sleeping state (S1 through S4), a system in S5 is not performing any computational tasks and appears to be off. Unlike S1-S4, however, a system in S5 does not retain memory state.

When in state S4, the computer can restart from the hibernate file; restarting from state S5 requires rebooting the system.

State S5 has the following characteristics:

| &nbsp; | &nbsp; |
| ---- |:---- |
| **Power consumption** | Off, except for trickle current to devices such as the power button. |
| **Software resumption** | Boot is required upon awakening. |
| **Hardware latency** | Long and undefined. Only physical interaction, such as the user pressing the ON switch, returns the system to the working state. The BIOS can also awaken from a resume timer if the system is so configured. |
| **System hardware context** | None retained. |

For a comparison between system power states and more info on S5, see [System Power States](/windows/win32/power/system-power-states).

For info on S1-S4, see [System Sleeping States](./system-sleeping-states.md).
