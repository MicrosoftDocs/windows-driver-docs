# Using Files In A Driver





The Microsoft Windows executive represents files by *file objects*, which are executive objects that are managed by the object manager. (Directories are also represented by file objects.)

Kernel-mode components refer to a file by its object name, which is **\\DosDevices** concatenated to the file's full path. (On Microsoft Windows 2000 and later versions of the operating system, **\\??** is equivalent to **\\DosDevices**.) For example, the object name of the C:\\WINDOWS\\example.txt file is **\\DosDevices\\C:\\WINDOWS\\example.txt**. You use the object name to open a handle to a file. For more information about object names, see [Object Names](object-names.md).

### To use a file

1.  Open a handle to the file.

    For more information, see [Opening a Handle to a File](opening-a-handle-to-a-file.md).

2.  Perform the intended operations by calling the appropriate **Zw*Xxx*File** routines.

    For more information, see [Using a File Handle](using-a-file-handle.md).

3.  Close the handle by calling [**ZwClose**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ntifs/nf-ntifs-ntclose).

Every time that you open a handle to a file, the Windows executive creates a file object that represents the file, and it returns an open handle to that object. Therefore, multiple file objects can exist for a single file. (Because a user-mode application can copy a handle, multiple handles can also exist for the same file object.) After all the open handles to a file object are closed, the Windows executive deletes the file object.
