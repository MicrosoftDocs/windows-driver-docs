# Using a CustomTimerDpc Routine





To disable a previously set timer object, a driver calls [**KeCancelTimer**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-kecanceltimer). This routine removes the timer object from the system's timer queue. Generally, the timer object is not set to the signaled state and the *CustomTimerDpc* routine is not queued for execution. However, if the timer is about to expire when **KeCancelTimer** is called, expiration might occur before **KeCancelTimer** has a chance to access the time queue, in which case signaling and DPC queuing will occur.

Recalling [**KeSetTimer**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-kesettimer) or [**KeSetTimerEx**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-kesettimerex), with previously specified *Timer* and *Dpc* pointers, before the previously specified interval expires, has the following effects:

-   The kernel removes the timer object from the timer queue, without setting the object to the signaled state or queuing the *CustomTimerDpc* routine.

-   The kernel reinserts the timer object in the timer queue, using the new *DueTime* value.

Using the same timer object for different purposes can cause race conditions or serious driver errors. For example, assume that a driver specifies a single timer object both to set up a call to a *CustomTimerDpc* routine and to set up waits in a driver-dedicated thread. Whenever the driver-dedicated thread calls **KeSetTimer**, **KeSetTimerEx**, or **KeCancelTimer** for the common timer object, the thread would cancel calls to the *CustomTimerDpc* routine, if the timer object was already queued for a *CustomTimerDpc* call.

If a driver has *CustomTimerDpc* routines, and also waits on timer objects in a nonarbitrary thread context, it should:

-   Never use a thread-context-sensitive timer object in a nonarbitrary thread context, or vice versa.

-   Allocate a separate timer object for each *CustomTimerDpc* routine. Each set of driver threads or driver routines that are called in a nonarbitrary thread context should have its own set of "waitable" timer objects.

If you use a *CustomTimerDpc* routine, choose carefully the interval the driver passes in calls to **KeSetTimer** or **KeSetTimerEx**. In addition, consider all possible effects of a call to **KeCancelTimer** with the same timer object from any driver routine that makes this call, particularly on SMP platforms.

Keep in mind the following fact about *CustomTimerDpc* routines:

Only one instantiation of a DPC object representing a particular DPC routine can be queued for execution at any given moment.

If a second driver routine calls **KeSetTimer** or **KeSetTimerEx** to run the same *CustomTimerDpc* routine before the interval specified by the first caller expires, the *CustomTimerDpc* routine is run only after the interval specified by the second caller expires. In these circumstances, the *CustomTimerDpc* does none of the work for which the first routine called **KeSetTimer** or **KeSetTimerEx**.

For drivers that have *CustomTimerDpc* routines and use periodic timers:

A driver cannot deallocate a periodic timer from a DPC routine. Drivers can deallocate only nonperiodic timers from a DPC routine.

Consider the following a design guideline for drivers that have both *CustomDpc* and *CustomTimerDpc* routines:

To prevent race conditions, never pass the same *Dpc* pointer to **KeSetTimer** or **KeSetTimerEx** and [**KeInsertQueueDpc**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-keinsertqueuedpc).

In other words, suppose a driver's *StartIo* routine calls **KeSetTimer** or **KeSetTimerEx** to queue a *CustomTimerDpc* routine, and the driver's ISR calls **KeInsertQueueDpc** simultaneously from another processor with the same *Dpc* pointer. That DPC routine will be run when IRQL on a processor falls below DISPATCH\_LEVEL or the timer interval expires, whichever comes first. Whichever does come first, some essential work for the *StartIo* or ISR would simply be dropped by the DPC routine.

In addition, a DPC used by two standard driver routines with very different functionality would have poorer performance characteristics than separate *CustomTimerDpc* and *CustomDpc* routines. The DPC would have to determine which operations to carry out, depending on the conditions that caused the *StartIo* routine or ISR to queue it. Testing for these conditions in the DPC would use additional CPU cycles.
