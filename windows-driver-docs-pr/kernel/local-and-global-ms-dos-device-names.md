# Local and Global MS-DOS Device Names

The Microsoft Windows 2000 and later versions of the Windows NT-based operating system maintain multiple versions of the **DosDevices** directory.

On these operating systems, there is one *global* **\\DosDevices** directory and multiple *local* **\\DosDevices** directories. The global **\\DosDevices** directory holds the MS-DOS device names that are visible system-wide. A local **\\DosDevices** directory holds MS-DOS device names that are visible only in a particular *local* **DosDevices** *context*.

The local **DosDevices** contexts are as follows.

-   On Windows XP and later, each logon session has its own local **DosDevices** context. System threads, and any thread that is running as the LocalSystem user, do not run in a local **DosDevices** context.

-   On Windows 2000, each terminal server session has its own local **DosDevices** context. Any thread that is running as part of the console session does not run in a local **DosDevices** context.

Each thread has a current **DosDevices** context, which can change over the lifetime of a thread. A thread that does not run in a local **DosDevices** context is said to run in the *global* **DosDevices** *context*. Thus, the system account runs in the global **DosDevices** context.

If a thread is currently running in a local **DosDevices** context, any MS-DOS device names that it creates are created only in the local **DosDevices** directory. Thus, threads that are running in a local **DosDevices** context cannot affect the MS-DOS device names that are visible to threads that are running in another local **DosDevices** context or in the global **DosDevices** context. For example, if a user on Windows XP or later mounts a network drive as **X:**, this does not affect the meaning of **X:** for any other user, or for the system as a whole.

On Windows XP and later, when the object manager looks up a name in **\\DosDevices**, it first searches the local **\\DosDevices** directory, and then the global **\\DosDevices** directory. If the name exists in both places, the local name shadows the global name.

On Windows 2000, whenever a new terminal server session is initiated, the system builds local \\**DosDevices** directory by copying the global **\\DosDevices** directory. Any subsequent changes to the global directory are not propagated to the local directory.

A driver that must create its MS-DOS device names in the global **\\DosDevices** directory can do so by creating its symbolic links in a standard driver routine that is guaranteed to run in a system thread context, such as **DriverEntry**. Alternatively, the global **\\DosDevices** directory is available as **\\DosDevices\\Global**; drivers can use a name of the **\\DosDevices\\Global\\**<em>DosDeviceName</em> to specify a name in the global directory.

Note that **\\DosDevices\\Global** does not exist on platforms that do not support local and global versions of **\\DosDevices**, such as Windows 98/Me. The following code example creates a global symbolic link that works on Windows 98/Me as well as Windows 2000 and later operating systems:

```cpp
UNICODE_STRING deviceName; // Already initialized.
UNICODE_STRING symbolicLinkName; // Initializing below.
NTSTATUS status;

if (IoIsWdmVersionAvailable(1, 0x10)) {
    // We're on Windows 2000 or later, so we use \DosDevices\Global.
 
    RtlInitUnicodeString(&symbolicLinkName, L"\\DosDevices\\Global\\SymbolicLinkName");

} else {
    // Windows 98/Me.  We just use DosDevices.
 
    RtlInitUnicodeString(&symbolicLinkName, L"\\DosDevices\\SymbolicLinkName");
}

status = IoCreateSymbolicLink(&symbolicLinkName, &deviceName);
if (!NT_SUCCESS(status)) {
  /* Symbolic link creation failed.  Handle error appropriately. */
}
```

A driver can create MS-DOS device names in a local **\\DosDevices** directories by creating the symbolic link in response to an IOCTL. When a thread in a particular local **DosDevices** context sends the IOCTL, the driver's *DispatchDeviceControl* is called from within the current thread context.

For more information about the context in which a standard driver routine runs, see [Dispatch Routines and IRQLs](dispatch-routines-and-irqls.md).

The system distinguishes local **\\DosDevices** directories as follows:

-   On Windows XP and later, local **\\DosDevices** directories are identified by the **AuthenticationID** for the logon session's access token. For more information about the **AuthenticationID**, see the description of the **TOKEN\_STATISTICS** structure in the Microsoft Windows SDK documentation.

-   On Windows 2000, local **\\DosDevices** directories are identified by the **SessionId** for the terminal server session. For more information about the **SessionId**, see the description of the **WTS\_SESSION\_INFO** structure in the Windows SDK documentation.

Windows NT 4.0 Terminal Server Edition supports local \\**DosDevices** directories in the exact same manner as Windows 2000.
