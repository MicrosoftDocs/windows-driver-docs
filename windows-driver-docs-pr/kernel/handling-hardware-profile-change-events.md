# Handling Hardware Profile Change Events





At specific times during a hardware profile change, the PnP manager calls notification callback routines that registered for **EventCategoryHardwareProfileChange**:

-   Before there is a change in the machine's hardware profile, the PnP manager calls registered notification callback routines and specifies a *NotificationStructure*.**Event** of GUID\_HWPROFILE\_QUERY\_CHANGE.

-   After the machine's hardware profile change is complete, the PnP manager calls registered notification callback routines and specifies a *NotificationStructure*.**Event** of GUID\_HWPROFILE\_CHANGE\_COMPLETE.

-   If the machine's hardware profile change is canceled, the PnP manager calls registered notification callback routines and specifies a *NotificationStructure*.**Event** of GUID\_HWPROFILE\_CHANGE\_CANCELLED.

For a GUID\_HWPROFILE\_QUERY\_CHANGE event the PnP manager calls user-mode callback routines and then calls kernel-mode callback routines. In response to a GUID\_HWPROFILE\_QUERY\_CHANGE event, a driver's notification callback routine typically just returns STATUS\_SUCCESS.

For a GUID\_HWPROFILE\_CHANGE\_COMPLETE event the PnP manager calls kernel-mode callback routines and then calls user-mode callback routines. In response to such an event, a driver's callback routine might refresh its hardware-profile-specific settings.

For a GUID\_HWPROFILE\_CHANGE\_CANCELLED event the PnP manager calls kernel-mode callback routines and then user-mode routines. In response to such an event, a driver's callback routine typically just returns STATUS\_SUCCESS. If the driver performed any operations in response to the GUID\_HWPROFILE\_QUERY\_CHANGE event, the driver would undo those operations in response to the cancellation event.
