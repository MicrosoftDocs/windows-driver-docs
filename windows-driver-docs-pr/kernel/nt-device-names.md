# NT Device Names





A named device object has a name of the form **\\Device\\**<em>DeviceName</em>. This is known as the *NT device name* of the device object.

### Device Names for WDM Drivers

WDM drivers do not name their device objects directly. Instead, the system imposes a uniform naming scheme that ensures that device names do not conflict between drivers. The naming scheme for WDM drivers is as follows.

-   The PDO for a device is named. The bus driver requests named PDOs for the devices it enumerates. The bus driver specifies the FILE\_AUTOGENERATED\_DEVICE\_NAME device characteristic when it creates the device object. For more information, see [Specifying Device Characteristics](specifying-device-characteristics.md). The system then automatically generates the device name.

-   FDOs and filter DOs are not named. Function and filter drivers do not request a name when creating the device object.

Any I/O request to a named device object automatically goes to the top object in that device object's stack. Thus, only the PDO is required to be named. User-mode applications do not refer to WDM device objects by name; instead, applications access the device object through its [*device interface*](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff556277#wdkgloss-device-interface). For more information, see [Device Interface Classes](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff541339).

Driver writers must not name more than one object in a device stack. The operating system checks security settings based on the named object. If two different objects are named and have different security descriptors, the I/O requests that are sent to the object with the weaker security descriptor can reach the device object with the stronger security descriptor.

### Device Names for non-WDM Drivers

A non-WDM driver must explicitly specify a name for any named device objects. The driver must create at least one named device object in the **\\Device** object directory to receive I/O requests. The driver specifies the device name as the *DeviceName* parameter to [**IoCreateDeviceSecure**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff548407) when creating the device object.
