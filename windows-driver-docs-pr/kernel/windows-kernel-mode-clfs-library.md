# Windows Kernel-Mode CLFS Library


Windows provides a transactional logging system for system files. This system is called the Common Log File System (CLFS). For more information about CLFS, see [Common Log File System](using-common-log-file-system.md).

Routines that provide a direct interface for CLFS are prefixed with the letters "**Clfs**"; for a list of CLFS library routines, see [Common Log File System (CLFS) Library Routines](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff541804). CLFS also provides a list of routines that you can implement to manage a CLFS; for more information on CLFS management, see [CLFS Management Library Routines](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff541830).

CLFS is a technology that is related to transacted file systems; for more information about transactions, see [Windows Kernel-Mode Transaction Manager](windows-kernel-mode-kernel-transaction-manager.md).
