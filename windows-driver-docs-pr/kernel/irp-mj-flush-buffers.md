# IRP\_MJ\_FLUSH\_BUFFERS


Drivers of devices with internal caches for data and drivers that maintain internal buffers for data must handle this request in a [*DispatchFlushBuffers*](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nc-wdm-driver_dispatch) routine.

## When Sent

Receipt of a flush request indicates that the driver should flush the device's cache or its internal buffer, or, possibly, should discard the data in its internal buffer.

## Input Parameters


None

## Output Parameters


None

## Operation

The driver transfers any data currently cached in the device or held in the driver's internal buffers before completing the flush request. The driver of an input-only device that buffers data internally might simply discard the currently buffered device data before completing the flush IRP, depending on the nature of its device.
