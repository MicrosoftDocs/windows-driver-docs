# Kernel-Mode Driver Components





This section introduces the standard routines contained in kernel-mode drivers. Some of these *standard driver routines* are required; others are optional. The section also introduces *driver objects*, which contain pointers to each driver's standard routines.

Some drivers interact with a system-supplied port driver or class driver that defines much of the driver's required functionality. For example, a SCSI miniport driver primarily interacts with the SCSI port driver. For such drivers, see the class-specific documentation for details of required and optional driver support.

This section includes:

[Introduction to Standard Driver Routines](introduction-to-standard-driver-routines.md)
