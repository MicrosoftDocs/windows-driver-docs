# Timer Objects


Any driver can use a timer object within a nonarbitrary thread context to time-out operations in the driver's other routines, or to schedule operations to be performed periodically. Starting with Windows 2000, timer objects based on the [**KTIMER**](./eprocess.md) structure are available to use with [**KeSetTimer**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-kesettimer) and the other **Ke*Xxx*Timer** routines. Starting with WindowsÂ 8.1, timer objects based on the [**EX\_TIMER**](./eprocess.md) structure are available to use with [**ExSetTimer**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-exsettimer) and the other **Ex*Xxx*Timer** routines. Timer objects based on the **KTIMER** and **EX\_TIMER** structures are [kernel dispatcher objects](./introduction-to-kernel-dispatcher-objects.md) that are signaled when a timer expires. Timer expiration can be periodic or one-shot (nonperiodic).

This section contains the following topics:

-   [KeXxxTimer Routines, KTIMER Objects, and DPCs](timer-objects-and-dpcs.md)

-   [ExXxxTimer Routines and EX\_TIMER Objects](exxxxtimer-routines-and-ex-timer-objects.md)
