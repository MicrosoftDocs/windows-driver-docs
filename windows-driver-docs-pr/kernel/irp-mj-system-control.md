# IRP\_MJ\_SYSTEM\_CONTROL


All drivers must provide a [*DispatchSystemControl*](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nc-wdm-driver_dispatch) routine that handles **IRP\_MJ\_SYSTEM\_CONTROL** requests, which are sent by the kernel-mode component of [Windows Management Instrumentation](./implementing-wmi.md) (WMI).

## When Sent

The WMI kernel-mode component can send an **IRP\_MJ\_SYSTEM\_CONTROL** request any time following a driver's successful registration as a supplier of WMI data. WMI IRPs typically are sent when a user-mode data consumer has requested WMI data.

## Input Parameters


Depends on the value at **MinorFunction** in the current I/O stack location of the IRP. Every **IRP\_MJ\_SYSTEM\_CONTROL** request specifies a minor function code that identifies the requested WMI action.

## Output Parameters


Depends on the value at **MinorFunction** in the current I/O stack location of the IRP.

## Operation

All drivers must support **IRP\_MJ\_SYSTEM\_CONTROL** requests by supplying a [*DispatchSystemControl*](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nc-wdm-driver_dispatch) routine.

Drivers that support [Windows Management Instrumentation](./implementing-wmi.md) (WMI) must handle **IRP\_MJ\_SYSTEM\_CONTROL** requests by processing the minor function codes associated with this major function code. For information about the WMI minor function codes, see [WMI Minor IRPs](wmi-minor-irps.md).

Drivers that do not support WMI by [registering as a WMI data provider](./registering-as-a-wmi-data-provider.md) must pass **IRP\_MJ\_SYSTEM\_CONTROL** requests to the next lower driver.
