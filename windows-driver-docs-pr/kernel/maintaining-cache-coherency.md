# Maintaining Cache Coherency


When a driver is transferring data between system memory and its device, data can be cached in one or more processor caches and/or in the system DMA controller's cache. Drivers that use DMA or PIO to service read/write IRPs or any device I/O control request that requires a DMA or PIO data transfer operation should ensure the integrity of possibly cached data during transfer operations. This section explains how to do so.

This section contains the following topics:
