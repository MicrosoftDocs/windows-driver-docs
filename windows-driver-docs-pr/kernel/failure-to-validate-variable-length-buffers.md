# Failure to Validate Variable-Length Buffers





Drivers often accept input buffers with fixed headers and trailing variable length data, as in the following example:

```cpp
   typedef struct _WAIT_FOR_BUFFER {
      LARGE_INTEGER Timeout;
      ULONG NameLength;
      BOOLEAN TimeoutSpecified;
      WCHAR Name[1];
   } WAIT_FOR_BUFFER, *PWAIT_FOR_BUFFER;

   if (InputBufferLength < sizeof(WAIT_FOR_BUFFER)) {
      IoCompleteRequest( Irp, STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER );
      return( STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER );
   }

   WaitBuffer = Irp->AssociatedIrp.SystemBuffer;

   if (FIELD_OFFSET(WAIT_FOR_BUFFER, Name[0]) +
          WaitBuffer->NameLength > InputBufferLength) {
       IoCompleteRequest( Irp, STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER );
       return( STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER );
   }
```

If **WaitBuffer-&gt;NameLength** is a very large ULONG value, adding it to the offset could cause an integer overflow. Instead, a driver should subtract the offset (fixed header size) from the **InputBufferLength** (buffer size), and test if the result leaves enough room for the **WaitBuffer-&gt;NameLength** (variable length data), as in the following example:

```cpp
   if (InputBufferLength < sizeof(WAIT_FOR_BUFFER)) {
      IoCompleteRequest( Irp, STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER );
      Return( STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER );
   }

   WaitBuffer = Irp->AssociatedIrp.SystemBuffer;

   if ((InputBufferLength -
         FIELD_OFFSET(WAIT_FOR_BUFFER, Name[0])  <
         WaitBuffer->NameLength) {
      IoCompleteRequest( Irp, STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER );
      return( STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER );
   }
```

In other words, if the buffer size minus the fixed header size leaves fewer than the number of bytes required for the variable length data, we return failure.

The subtraction above cannot underflow because the first **if** statement ensures that the **InputBufferLength** is greater than or equal to the size of **WAIT\_FOR\_BUFFER**.

The following shows a more complicated overflow problem:

```cpp
   case IOCTL_SET_VALUE:
      dwSize = sizeof(SET_VALUE);

      if (inputBufferLength < dwSize) {
         ntStatus = STATUS_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL;
         break;
      }

      dwSize = FIELD_OFFSET(SET_VALUE, pInfo[0]) +
                  pSetValue->NumEntries * sizeof(SET_VALUE_INFO);

      if (inputBufferLength < dwSize) {
         ntStatus = STATUS_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL;
         break;
      }
```

In this example, an integer overflow can occur during multiplication. If the size of the **SET\_VALUE\_INFO** structure is a multiple of 2, a **NumEntries** value such as 0x80000000 results in an overflow, when the bits are shifted left during multiplication. However, the buffer size will nevertheless pass the validation test, because the overflow causes **dwSize** to appear quite small. To avoid this problem, subtract the lengths as in the previous example, divide by **sizeof**(**SET\_VALUE\_INFO**), and compare the result with **NumEntries**.
