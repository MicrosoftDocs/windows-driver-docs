# Writing an AddDevice Routine





Any driver that supports PnP must have an [*AddDevice*](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nc-wdm-driver_add_device) routine. The *AddDevice* routine creates one or more device objects representing the physical, logical, or virtual devices for which the driver carries out I/O requests. It also attaches the device object to the device stack, so the device stack will contain a device object for each driver associated with the device.

The PnP manager calls a driver's *AddDevice* routine for each device controlled by the driver. *AddDevice* routines are called during system initialization (when devices are first enumerated), and any time a new device is enumerated while the system is running.
