# Programming Issues for 64-Bit Drivers


## <a href="" id="ddk-64-bit-issues-kg"></a>


This section discusses issues you need to be concerned about when developing drivers for 64-bit processing environments. It includes the following sections:

[Porting Your Driver to 64-Bit Windows](porting-your-driver-to-64-bit-windows.md)

[Supporting 32-Bit I/O in Your 64-Bit Driver](supporting-32-bit-i-o-in-your-64-bit-driver.md)

[Driver x64 Restrictions](driver-x64-restrictions.md)

For information about programming with a 64-bit compiler, see [64-Bit Programming with Visual C++](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=165521).
