# IRP\_MN\_DEVICE\_ENUMERATED


The PnP manager uses this I/O request packet (IRP) to notify bus drivers that a device object exists and that it has been fully enumerated by the plug and play manager.

## Value

0x19

## Major Code

[**IRP\_MJ\_PNP**](irp-mj-pnp.md)

## When Sent

The PnP manager sends this IRP just before user mode is notified with GUID\_DEVICE\_ENUMERATED. This IRP allows drivers to provide a preprocess routine for IRP\_MN\_DEVICE\_ENUMERATED, such as filling in additional device properties. This IRP primarily allows drivers to set device properties for the physical device object (PDO) by using [**IoSetDevicePropertyData**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-iosetdevicepropertydata).

## Input Parameters


None

## Output Parameters


None

## I/O Status Block


A driver that handles this IRP sets [Irp-&gt;IoStatus.Status](./i-o-status-blocks.md) to STATUS\_SUCCESS or an appropriate error status.

## Operation

The **IRP\_MN\_DEVICE\_ENUMERATED** IRP is sent to the bus driver's PDO to indicate that the bus driver PDO exists.

## Sending the IRP


Reserved for system use. Drivers must not send this IRP.
