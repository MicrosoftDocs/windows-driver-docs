# Sending WMI Events





A driver can use WMI events to notify user-mode applications of events without requiring the applications to poll or send IRPs. A driver should use WMI events to notify WMI clients of exceptional conditions, not as an alternative to error logging. A driver should support any standard event blocks defined for its device type in Wmicore.mof, and might define and register additional custom event blocks to support device-specific notifications.

An event block is simply a data block that derives from the abstract base class **WMIEvent**. An event block can contain any of the same data as a data block, or it can be empty—that is, an event block need not contain any driver-defined data items. If an event block does contain data, the total size of the **WNODE\_*XXX*** plus the data should not exceed the registry-defined limit of 1 kilobyte. In general, smaller events result in better system performance and more timely notification. For information about defining blocks, see [MOF Syntax for WMI Data and Event Blocks](mof-syntax-for-wmi-data-and-event-blocks.md) and [Designing WMI Data and Event Blocks](designing-wmi-data-and-event-blocks.md).

A driver indicates support for an event by registering the corresponding event block with WMIREG\_FLAG\_EVENT\_ONLY\_GUID set in the block's [**WMIREGGUID**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wmistr/ns-wmistr-wmiregguidw) structure. For information about registering blocks, see [Registering as a WMI Data Provider](registering-as-a-wmi-data-provider.md).

When a WMI client user requests notification of an event, WMI sends an [**IRP\_MN\_ENABLE\_EVENTS**](./irp-mn-enable-events.md) request to the driver, which alerts the driver to begin monitoring the event's driver-determined trigger condition. Then, when the trigger condition occurs, the driver sends the event to WMI, which delivers it to all data consumers that have registered for the event.

A driver sends an event to WMI in one of the following ways:

- Call the kernel-mode WMI library routine [**WmiFireEvent**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wmilib/nf-wmilib-wmifireevent). A driver can call **WmiFireEvent** to send only events that do not use dynamic instance names, and that base static instance names on a single base name string or the device instance ID of a PDO. Furthermore, the event must be a single instance—that is, a driver cannot call **WmiFireEvent** to send an event that consists of a single item or multiple instances. For more information, see [Sending an Event with WmiFireEvent](sending-an-event-with-wmifireevent.md).

- Call the kernel-mode routine [**IoWMIWriteEvent**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-iowmiwriteevent) with a pointer to a driver-allocated and initialized **WNODE\_*XXX*** structure that contains the event's data. For more information, see [Sending an Event with IoWMIWriteEvent](sending-an-event-with-iowmiwriteevent.md).
