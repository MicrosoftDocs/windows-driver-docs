# DispatchShutdown Routines





A driver's [*DispatchShutdown*](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nc-wdm-driver_dispatch) routine handles IRPs for the [**IRP\_MJ\_SHUTDOWN**](./irp-mj-shutdown.md) I/O function code. Drivers of mass-storage devices that have internal caches for data must handle this request. Drivers of mass-storage devices and intermediate drivers layered over them also must handle this request if an underlying driver maintains internal buffers for data.
