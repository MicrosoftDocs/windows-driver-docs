System power state S0, the system working state, has the following characteristics:

<a href="" id="power-consumption"></a>**Power consumption**  
Maximum. However, the power state of individual devices can change dynamically as power conservation takes place on a per-device basis. Unused devices can be powered down and powered up as needed.

<a href="" id="software-resumption"></a>**Software resumption**  
Not applicable.

<a href="" id="hardware-latency"></a>**Hardware latency**  
None.
