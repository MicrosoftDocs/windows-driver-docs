# Using PnP Custom Notification





A driver can use the target device change notification mechanism to be notified of custom events on a device.

The programmer that defines the custom event must do the following:

1.  Define a new GUID for the custom event.

    Generate the GUID with **Uuidgen** or **Guidgen** (which are included in the Microsoft Windows SDK). Publish the GUID in an appropriate header file and documentation.

2.  Write code to trigger the custom event.

    In kernel mode, a driver calls [**IoReportTargetDeviceChange**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-ioreporttargetdevicechange) with the custom GUID and a pointer to the PDO for the device. Custom events can only be triggered from kernel mode.

A driver writer uses custom notification with a procedure like the following:

1.  The driver (or application) registers for notification of the custom event.

    In kernel mode, a driver calls [**IoRegisterPlugPlayNotification**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-ioregisterplugplaynotification) and registers for an **EventCategoryTargetDeviceChange** on the device.

    In user mode, an application registers using **RegisterDeviceNotification**. See the Windows SDK for further information.

2.  A kernel-mode component triggers the custom event.

3.  The PnP manager calls notification routines registered on the device.

    The PnP manager calls the registered user-mode callback routines and then calls the kernel-mode callback routines.

4.  When user-mode notification is complete, the kernel-mode driver notification callback routine(s) respond to the custom event.

    See [Guidelines for Writing PnP Notification Callback Routines](guidelines-for-writing-pnp-notification-callback-routines.md) for general guidelines for notification callback routines. In addition to those guidelines, a custom notification callback routine must not open a handle to a device from within the callback routine thread.
