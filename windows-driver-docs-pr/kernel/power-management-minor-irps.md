# Power Management Minor IRPs





All power IRPs have the major code [**IRP\_MJ\_POWER**](irp-mj-power.md) and one of the following minor codes, indicating a specific power management request:

[**IRP\_MN\_POWER\_SEQUENCE**](irp-mn-power-sequence.md)

[**IRP\_MN\_QUERY\_POWER**](irp-mn-query-power.md)

[**IRP\_MN\_SET\_POWER**](irp-mn-set-power.md)

[**IRP\_MN\_WAIT\_WAKE**](irp-mn-wait-wake.md)

This section provides reference information for the individual IRPs in alphabetical order. For more information about when the IRPs are sent and how drivers should handle them, see [Power Management](./introduction-to-power-management.md). The Power Management section also includes a general introduction to power management and terminology.
