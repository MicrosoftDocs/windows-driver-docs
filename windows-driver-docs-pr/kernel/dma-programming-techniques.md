# DMA Programming Techniques


Direct Memory Access (DMA) is a data transfer strategy that bypasses the CPU, instead using a dedicated DMA controller to transfer data between memory and a device.

Drivers can use the DMA controller to transfer data directly. To get started, see [Introduction to Adapter Objects](./introduction-to-adapter-objects.md).

DMA programming techniques include:

* [Scatter/Gather DMA](./using-scatter-gather-dma.md)
* [Common-Buffer System DMA](./using-common-buffer-system-dma.md)
* [Bus-Master DMA](./using-bus-master-dma.md)

Version 3 of the DMA operations interface is available starting with Windows 8. For more information about this interface, see [Version 3 of the DMA Operations Interface](./version-3-of-the-dma-operations-interface.md).
