# IRP\_MN\_READ\_CONFIG


Bus drivers for buses with configuration space must handle this request for their child devices (child PDOs). Filter and function drivers do not handle this request.

## Value

0x0F

## Major Code

[**IRP\_MJ\_PNP**](irp-mj-pnp.md)

## When Sent

A driver or other system component sends this IRP to read the configuration space of a device's parent bus.

A driver or other system component sends this IRP at IRQL &lt; DISPATCH\_LEVEL in an arbitrary thread context.

## Input Parameters


The **Parameters.ReadWriteConfig** member of the [**IO\_STACK\_LOCATION**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/ns-wdm-_io_stack_location) structure is itself a structure containing the following information:

```cpp
ULONG WhichSpace;
PVOID Buffer;
ULONG Offset;
ULONG Length
```

The members of the structure can be interpreted differently by different bus drivers, but the members are typically defined as follows:

<a href="" id="whichspace"></a>**WhichSpace**  
Specifies which memory area to access. This parameter can take the following values:

<table>
<colgroup>
<col width="33%" />
<col width="33%" />
<col width="33%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Value</th>
<th>Bus</th>
<th>Meaning</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>PCI_WHICHSPACE_CONFIG</p></td>
<td><p>PCI</p></td>
<td><p>PCI configuration space.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>PCI_WHICHSPACE_ROM</p></td>
<td><p>PCI</p></td>
<td><p>Read-only memory.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>PCCARD_COMMON_MEMORY</p>
<p>PCCARD_COMMON_MEMORY_INDIRECT</p></td>
<td><p>PCMCIA</p></td>
<td><p>Main PCCARD memory.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>PCCARD_ATTRIBUTE_MEMORY</p>
<p>PCCARD_ATTRIBUTE_MEMORY_INDIRECT</p></td>
<td><p>PCMCIA</p></td>
<td><p>PCMCIA attribute (configuration) space.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>PCCARD_PCI_CONFIGURATION_SPACE</p></td>
<td><p>PCMCIA</p></td>
<td><p>PCI configuration space.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

 

The PCI\_*XXX* values are defined in Wdm.h. The PCCARD\_*XXX* values are defined in Ntddpcm.h.

<a href="" id="buffer"></a>**Buffer**  
Points to a buffer in which to return the requested information. The component sending the IRP allocates this structure from paged memory. The format of the buffer is bus-specific.

<a href="" id="offset"></a>**Offset**  
Specifies an offset into the configuration space.

<a href="" id="length"></a>**Length**  
Specifies the number of bytes to read.

## Output Parameters


On success, a bus driver fills the buffer at **Parameters.ReadWriteConfig.Buffer** with the requested data.

## I/O Status Block


A bus driver sets **Irp-&gt;IoStatus.Status** to STATUS\_SUCCESS or to an appropriate error status such as STATUS\_INVALID\_PARAMETER\_*n*, STATUS\_NO\_SUCH\_DEVICE, or STATUS\_DEVICE\_NOT\_READY.

On success, a bus driver sets **Irp-&gt;IoStatus.Information** to the number of bytes returned.

If a bus driver is unable to complete this request immediately it can mark the IRP pending, return STATUS\_PENDING, and complete the IRP at a later time.

## Operation

A bus driver handles this IRP for its child devices (child PDOs).

Function and filter drivers do not handle this IRP; they pass it to the next lower driver with no changes to **Irp-&gt;IoStatus**.Status and they do not set an [*IoCompletion*](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nc-wdm-io_completion_routine) routine.

A bus driver that handles this request should check the WhichSpace parameter to ensure that it contains a value that the driver supports.

See [Plug and Play](./introduction-to-plug-and-play.md) for the general rules for handling [Plug and Play minor IRPs](plug-and-play-minor-irps.md).

**Sending This IRP**

Typically, a function driver sends this IRP to the top driver in the device stack to which it is attached and the IRP is handled by the parent bus driver.

See [Handling IRPs](./handling-irps.md) for information about sending IRPs. The following steps apply specifically to this IRP:

-   Allocate a buffer from a paged pool and initialize it to zeros.

-   Set the values in the next I/O stack location of the IRP: set **MajorFunction** to [**IRP\_MJ\_PNP**](irp-mj-pnp.md), set **MinorFunction** to **IRP\_MN\_READ\_CONFIG**, and set the appropriate values in **Parameters.ReadWriteConfig**.

-   Initialize **IoStatus.Status** to STATUS\_NOT\_SUPPORTED.

-   Deallocate the IRP and the buffer when they are no longer needed.

Drivers must send this IRP from IRQL &lt; DISPATCH\_LEVEL.

A driver can access a bus's configuration space at DISPATCH\_LEVEL through a bus interface routine, if the parent bus driver supports such an interface. To get a bus interface, a driver sends an [**IRP\_MN\_QUERY\_INTERFACE**](irp-mn-query-interface.md) request to the device stack in which the driver is attached. The driver then calls the appropriate routine returned in the interface.

For example, to read configuration space from DISPATCH\_LEVEL, a driver can call **IRP\_MN\_QUERY\_INTERFACE** during driver initialization to get the [**BUS\_INTERFACE\_STANDARD**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/ns-wdm-_bus_interface_standard) interface from the parent bus driver. The driver sends the query IRP from IRQL PASSIVE\_LEVEL. Later, from code at IRQL DISPATCH\_LEVEL, the driver calls the appropriate routine returned in the interface, such as the **Interface.GetBusData** routine.
