# Writing an Unload Routine





Any driver that can be replaced, or unloaded and reloaded, while the system is running must have an [*Unload*](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nc-wdm-driver_unload) routine. All WDM drivers must have *Unload* routines.

Although *Unload* routines are optional for non-WDM drivers, [Driver Verifier](../devtest/driver-verifier.md) will fail any driver that does not provide an *Unload* routine.

This section contains the following topics:

[Unload Routine Environment](unload-routine-environment.md)

[Unload Routine Functionality](unload-routine-functionality.md)
