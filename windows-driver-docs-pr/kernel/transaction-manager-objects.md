# Transaction Manager Objects


The main purpose of the *transaction manager object* is to create and maintain a [Common Log File System](introduction-to-the-common-log-file-system.md) (CLFS) log stream that KTM uses to record status information about transactions.

The transaction manager object also contains a [virtual clock value](using-virtual-clock-values.md) that KTM maintains and uses to sequence information in the object's log stream.

KTM provides a set of transaction manager object routines that kernel-mode [TPS components](understanding-tps-components.md) can call. KTM also provides a similar set of user-mode routines that user-mode applications can call. For more information about the user-mode routines, see the Microsoft Windows SDK.

KTM creates a transaction manager object when a resource manager calls [**ZwCreateTransactionManager**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-ntcreatetransactionmanager). Typically, each resource manager in a TPS creates a transaction manager object. But you can also design a TPS in which several resource managers share a single transaction manager object.

TPS components can open additional handles to an existing transaction manager object by calling [**ZwOpenTransactionManager**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-ntopentransactionmanager). For example, if your TPS has several resource managers that share a single transaction manager object, one resource manager calls **ZwCreateTransactionManager** and then passes the object GUID to the other resource managers so that they can call **ZwOpenTransactionManager**.

Resource managers close their handles to transaction manager objects by calling [**ZwClose**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ntifs/nf-ntifs-ntclose).

The operating system deletes the object after the last handle is closed and KTM has released all its references to the object.
