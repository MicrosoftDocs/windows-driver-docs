## Cause

The system encountered an unexpected error and restarted. Issues that may cause this error include: hardware watchdog timer in application or auxiliary processors indicating a system hang, user-initiated key sequence because of a hang, a brownout, or failures in the default bugcheck path. The cache may not be flushed and the resulting full memory dump may not contain the current thread context.
