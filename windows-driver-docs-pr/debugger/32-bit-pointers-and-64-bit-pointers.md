# 32-Bit Pointers and 64-Bit Pointers

The WdbgExts.h header file supports both 32-bit and 64-bit pointers. To use 64-bit pointers, simply include the following two lines in your code, in the following order:

```cpp
#define KDEXT_64BIT 
#include wdbgexts.h 
```

It is recommended that you always use 64-bit pointers in your code. This allows your extension to work on any platform, because the debugger will automatically cast 64-bit pointers to 32 bits when the target is 32-bit.

If you intend to use your extension only on 32-bit platforms, you can write a 32-bit extension instead. In that case, you only need to include the following line in your code:

```cpp
#include wdbgexts.h 
```
For additional information on working with the 64 bit pointers see [Using the DECLARE_API Macro](using-the-declare-api-macro.md) and [Writing WdbgExts Extension Code](writing-wdbgexts-extension-code.md). In addition, examine the sample code that is included as part of the WDK.
