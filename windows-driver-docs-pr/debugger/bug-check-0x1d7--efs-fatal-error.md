## EFS\_FATAL\_ERROR Parameters

|Parameter|Description|
|-------- |---------- |
|1| Bug Check Subclass:  **01** - Pre-offloading failure.|
|2| NTSTATUS return code of the operation.|
|3| The current IRP at the time of failure.|
|4| File encryption context at the time of failure.|

## Cause

An EFS error condition has occurred such that cannot be handled without data loss or data corruption.

## Resolution
-----

The [!analyze](../debuggercmds/-analyze.md) debug extension displays information about the bug check and can be helpful in determining the root cause.

Examine parameter 2 the NTSTATUS field to try and determine why NT_SUCCESS was not returned. This is the expected and only allowed value for file systems that call crypto pre-offloading.

Use the debugger [!IRP](../debuggercmds/-irp.md) command to investigate parameter 3 for a possible conflicting IRP code or other issues.
