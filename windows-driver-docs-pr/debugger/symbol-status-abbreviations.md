# Symbol Status Abbreviations


## <span id="ddk_symbol_status_abbreviations_dbg"></span><span id="DDK_SYMBOL_STATUS_ABBREVIATIONS_DBG"></span>


Symbol file types and their loading status can be determined by using the [**lm (List Loaded Modules)**](../debuggercmds/lm--list-loaded-modules-.md) command, the [**!lmi**](../debuggercmds/-lmi.md) extension, or WinDbg's **Debug | Modules** menu command.

Each of these displays information about loaded modules and their symbols.

The following abbreviations are used in the displays generated by these commands:

<table>
<colgroup>
<col width="50%" />

<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th align="left">Abbreviation</th>
<th align="left">Meaning</th>

<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="left"><p><strong>deferred</strong></p></td>
<td align="left"><p>The module has been loaded, but the debugger has not attempted to load the symbols. Symbols will be loaded when needed. See <a href="deferred-symbol-loading.md" data-raw-source="[Deferred Symbol Loading](deferred-symbol-loading.md)">Deferred Symbol Loading</a> for details.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td align="left"><p><strong>#</strong></p></td>

<td align="left"><p>The timestamp is missing, not accessible, or equal to zero.</p></td>

<tr class="odd">
<td align="left"><p><strong>M</strong></p></td>
