# Bug Check 0x165: CLUSTER\_CSV\_STATUS\_IO\_TIMEOUT\_LIVEDUMP

The CLUSTER\_CSV\_STATUS\_IO\_TIMEOUT\_LIVEDUMP live dump has a value of 0x00000165. This indicates that a SMB client on the non-coordinating node complains that an IO on coordinating node is taking too long and fails all IOs with STATUS_IO_TIMEOUT.

## CLUSTER\_CSV\_STATUS\_IO\_TIMEOUT\_LIVEDUMP Parameters

|Parameter|Description|
|--- |--- |
|1|Optional cluster service PID.|
|2|Cluster Node Id for the node that observed STATUS_IO_TIMEOUT.|
|3|Reserved.|
|4|Reserved.|

## Cause

A SMB client on the non-coordinating node complains that an IO on coordinating node is taking too long and fails all IOs with STATUS_IO_TIMEOUT.

Additional information is available in the dump's secondary data streams.

(This code can never be used for a real bugcheck; it is used to identify live dumps including Cluster Shared Volume telemetry.)
