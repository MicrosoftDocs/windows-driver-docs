# Bug check 0xA: IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL

The IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL bug check has a value of 0x0000000A. This bug check indicates that Microsoft Windows or a kernel-mode driver accessed paged memory at an invalid address while at a raised interrupt request level (IRQL). The cause is typically a bad pointer or a pageability problem.

## IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL parameters

| Parameter | Description|
|-----------|------------|
| 1 | The virtual memory address that couldn't be accessed. <br><br> Use [!pool](../debuggercmds/-pool.md) on this address to see whether it's a paged pool. Other commands that might be useful in gathering information about the failure are [!pte](../debuggercmds/-pte.md), [!address](../debuggercmds/-address.md), and [ln (List Nearest Symbols)](../debuggercmds/ln--list-nearest-symbols-.md). |
| 2 | IRQL at time of the fault. <br><br> **Values**: <br> 2 - The IRQL was DISPATCH_LEVEL at the time of the fault. |
| 3 | Bit field that describes the operation that caused the fault. Note that bit 3 is only available on chipsets that support this level of reporting. <br><br> **Bit 0 values**: <br> 0 - Read operation <br> 1 - Write operation <br><br> **Bit 3 values**: <br> 0 - Not an execute operation <br> 1 - Execute operation <br><br> **Bit 0 and Bit 3 combined values**: <br> 0x0 - Fault trying to READ from the address in parameter 1 <br> 0x1 - Fault trying to WRITE to the address in parameter 1 <br> 0x8 - Fault trying to EXECUTE code from the address in parameter 1 <br><br> This value is caused by: <br> <ul><li>Calling a function that can't be called at DISPATCH_LEVEL while at DISPATCH_LEVEL.</li> <li>Forgetting to release a spinlock.</li> <li>Marking code as pageable when it must be non-pageable. For example, if the code acquires a spinlock, or is called in a deferred procedure call.</li> |
| 4 | The instruction pointer at the time of the fault. <br><br> Use the [ln (List Nearest Symbols)](../debuggercmds/ln--list-nearest-symbols-.md) command on this address to see the name of the function. |

## Cause

This bug check is caused by kernel-mode device drivers that use improper addresses.

This bug check indicates that an attempt was made to access an invalid address while at a raised interrupt request level (IRQL). The cause is either a bad memory pointer or a pageability problem with the device driver code.

General guidelines that you can use to categorize the type of coding error that caused the bug check are as follows:

- If parameter 1 is less than 0x1000, the issue is likely a NULL pointer dereference.

- If [!pool](../debuggercmds/-pool.md) reports that parameter 1 is paged pool (or other types of pageable memory), then the IRQL is too high to access this data. Run at a lower IRQL, or allocate the data in the nonpaged pool.

- If parameter 3 indicates that the bug check was an attempt to execute pageable code, then the IRQL is too high to call this function. Run at a lower IRQL, or don't mark the code as pageable.

- It may be a bad pointer caused by use-after-free or bit-flipping. Investigate the validity of parameter 1 with [!pte](../debuggercmds/-pte.md), [!address](../debuggercmds/-address.md), and [ln (list nearest symbols)](../debuggercmds/ln--list-nearest-symbols-.md).

## Resolution

If a kernel debugger is available, obtain a stack trace. Start by running the [!analyze](../debuggercmds/-analyze.md) debugger extension to display information about the bug check. The **!analyze** extension can be helpful in determining the root cause. Next, enter one of the [k* (display stack backtrace)](../debuggercmds/k--kb--kc--kd--kp--kp--kv--display-stack-backtrace-.md)  commands to view the call stack.

### Gather information

Examine the name of the driver if it was listed on the blue screen.

Check the System Log in Event Viewer for other error messages that might help pinpoint the device or driver that's causing the error. Look for critical errors in the system log that occurred in the same time frame as the blue screen.

### Driver Verifier

Driver Verifier is a tool that runs in real time to examine the behavior of drivers. For example, Driver Verifier checks the use of memory resources, such as memory pools. If it identifies errors in the execution of driver code, it proactively creates an exception to allow that part of the driver code to be further scrutinized. Driver Verifier Manager is built into Windows and is available on all Windows PCs.

To start Driver Verifier Manager, type **verifier** at a command prompt. You can configure which drivers to verify. The code that verifies drivers adds overhead as it runs, so try to verify the smallest number of drivers as possible. For more information, see [Driver Verifier](../devtest/driver-verifier.md).

## Remarks

The error that generates this bug check usually occurs after the installation of a faulty device driver, system service, or BIOS.

If you encounter bug check 0xA while upgrading to a newer version of Windows, the error might be caused by a device driver, a system service, a virus scanner, or a backup tool that's incompatible with the new version.

**Resolving a faulty hardware problem:** If hardware has been added to the system recently, remove it to see if the error recurs. If existing hardware has failed, remove or replace the faulty component. Run hardware diagnostics that are supplied by the system manufacturer. For details on these procedures, see the owner's manual for your computer.

**Resolving a faulty system service problem:** Disable the service and confirm whether doing so resolves the error. If so, contact the manufacturer of the system service about a possible update. If the error occurs during system startup, investigate the Windows repair options. For more information, see [Recovery options in Windows 10](https://support.microsoft.com/help/12415/windows-10-recovery-options).

**Resolving an antivirus software problem:** Disable the program and confirm whether doing so resolves the error. If it does, contact the manufacturer of the program about a possible update.
