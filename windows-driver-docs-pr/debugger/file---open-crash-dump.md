Click **Open Crash Dump** on the **File** menu to open a user-mode or kernel-mode crash dump file and to analyze it.

This command is equivalent to pressing CTRL+D. You can use this command only when WinDbg is in dormant mode.

### <span id="dialog_box"></span><span id="DIALOG_BOX"></span>Dialog Box

When you click **Open Crash Dump**, the **Open Crash Dump** dialog box appears. Enter the full path of the crash dump file in the **File name** box, or use the **Look in** list to find and select the proper path and file name. (Dump files typically end with the .dmp or .mdmp extension.)

After you choose the proper file, click **Open**.
