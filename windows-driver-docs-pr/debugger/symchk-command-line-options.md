## <span id="ddk_symchk_command_line_options_dtoolq"></span><span id="DDK_SYMCHK_COMMAND_LINE_OPTIONS_DTOOLQ"></span>Parameters


<span id="________r______"></span><span id="________R______"></span> **/r**   
If *Files* specifies a directory, the **/r** option causes SymChk to recursively search all subdirectories under this directory for program files.

<span id="________v______"></span><span id="________V______"></span> **/v**   
Displays verbose information. This includes the file name of every program file whose symbols were investigated and whether it passed, failed, or was ignored.

<span id="________q______"></span><span id="________Q______"></span> **/q**   
Enables quiet mode. All output will be suppressed (unless the **/ot** option is included).

<span id="_______FileNames______"></span><span id="_______filenames______"></span><span id="_______FILENAMES______"></span> *FileNames*   
Specifies the program files whose symbols are to be checked. Absolute paths, relative paths, and UNC paths are permitted. An asterisk (**\***) wildcard is permitted. If *FileNames</em> ends in a slash, it is taken to be a directory name, and all files within that directory are checked. If *FileNames* contains spaces, it must be enclosed in quotation marks.

<span id="________ie_______ExeFile______"></span><span id="________ie_______exefile______"></span><span id="________IE_______EXEFILE______"></span> **/ie** *ExeFile*   
Specifies the name of a program that is currently executing. The symbols for this program will be checked. *ExeFile* must include the name of the file and file extension (usually .exe), but no path information. If there are two different executables with the same name, this option is not recommended. *ExeFile* can specify any program, including a kernel-mode driver. If *ExeFile* is a single asterisk (**\***), SymChk will check the symbols for all running processes, including drivers.

<span id="________id_______DumpFile______"></span><span id="________id_______dumpfile______"></span><span id="________ID_______DUMPFILE______"></span> **/id** *DumpFile*   
Specifies a memory dump file. The symbols for this dump file will be checked.

<span id="________ih_______HotFixFile______"></span><span id="________ih_______hotfixfile______"></span><span id="________IH_______HOTFIXFILE______"></span> **/ih** *HotFixFile*   
Specifies a self-extracting Hotfix CAB file.

<span id="________ip_______ProcessID______"></span><span id="________ip_______processid______"></span><span id="________IP_______PROCESSID______"></span> **/ip** *ProcessID*   
Specifies the process ID of a program that is currently executing. The symbols for this program will be checked. *ProcessID* must be specified as a decimal number. There are two special wildcards supported:

- If *ProcessID* is zero ( **0** ), SymChk will check the symbols for all running drivers.

- If *ProcessID* is a single asterisk (**\***), SymChk will check the symbols for all running processes, including drivers.

<span id="________it_______TextFileList______"></span><span id="________it_______textfilelist______"></span><span id="________IT_______TEXTFILELIST______"></span> **/it** *TextFileList*   
Specifies a text file that contains a list of program files. The symbols for all these programs will be checked. *TextFileList* must specify exactly one file (by relative, absolute, or UNC path, but with no wildcards); if it contains spaces it should be enclosed in quotation marks. Within this file, each line indicates a program file (by relative, absolute, or UNC paths), and an asterisk wildcard (**\***) is permitted. However, any line using this wildcard must use a relative path.

If a line in this file contains spaces, it should be enclosed in quotation marks. A semicolon within this file is a comment character -- everything between a semicolon and the end of the line will be ignored.

<span id="________im_______ManifestList______"></span><span id="________im_______manifestlist______"></span><span id="________IM_______MANIFESTLIST______"></span> **/im** *ManifestList*   
Specifies that the input to the command is a manifest file previously created by using the **/om** parameter. The manifest file contains information about the files for which symbols are retrieved. For more information about using a manifest file, see [Using a Manifest File with SymChk](using-a-manifest-file-with-symchk.md).

<span id="________om_______Manifest______"></span><span id="________om_______manifest______"></span><span id="________OM_______MANIFEST______"></span> **/om** *Manifest*   
Specifies that a manifest file is created. The manifest file contains information about a set of files for which symbols will be retrieved, by using the **/im** parameter, at a later time.

<span id="________s_Opts__SymbolPath"></span><span id="________s_opts__symbolpath"></span><span id="________S_OPTS__SYMBOLPATH"></span> **/s**\[*Opts*\] *SymbolPath*  
Specifies the directories containing symbols. Absolute paths, relative paths, and UNC paths are permitted. Any number of directories can be specified -- multiple directories should be separated with semicolons. If *SymbolPath* contains spaces, it must be enclosed in quotation marks. If you wish to specify a symbol server within this path, you should use one of the following syntaxes:

```dbgcmd
srv*DownstreamStore*\\Server\Share
srv*\\Server\Share
```

It is not recommended that you omit the **/s**\[*Opts*\] *SymbolPath* parameter, but if it is omitted, SymChk will point to the public symbol store by using the following default path:

```dbgcmd
srv*%SystemRoot%\symbols*https://msdl.microsoft.com/download/symbols
```

Any number of the following options can follow **/s**. There can be no space between the **/s** and these options:

<span id="e"></span><span id="E"></span>**e**  
SymChk will check each path individually instead of checking all paths at once.

<span id="u"></span><span id="U"></span>**u**  
Downstream stores will be updated. If the symbol path includes a downstream store, the symbol store will be searched for the symbol files. Only symbol stores that are being checked by SymChk will be updated.

<span id="p"></span><span id="P"></span>**p**  
Force checking for private symbols. Public symbols will be treated as not matching. The **p** option implies **e** and **u**, and cannot be used with **s**.

<span id="s"></span><span id="S"></span>**s**  
Force checking for public (split) symbols. Private symbols will be treated as not matching. The **s** option implies **e** and **u**, and cannot be used with **p**.

<span id="r"></span><span id="R"></span>**r**  
Expand all non-symbol server elements in the specified path in order to do a deep search of the path. NOTE: This option may produce matches that will not occur inside the debugger since it modifies the symbol path specified.


*Options*
The available options are divided into several classes. Each class of options controls a different set of features.

**Output options.** Any number of the following options can be specified. These options can be abbreviated by using **/o** only once -- for example, **/oi /oe** can be written as **/oie**.

Within <em>File</em>, each line indicates a program file (by relative, absolute, or UNC paths); no wildcards are permitted. If a line in this file contains spaces it should be enclosed in quotation marks.
