# dbgerr003: Mismatched Symbols


## <span id="ddk_dbgerr003_dbg"></span><span id="DDK_DBGERR003_DBG"></span>


Debugger error **dbgerr003** displays the message "*File* has mismatched symbols." This error indicates that DbgHelp found the symbol file represented by File, but that the symbol file is not the correct version, or that DbgHelp cannot confirm that the symbol file is the correct version.

The debugger might load the specified symbol file despite this error, depending on other requirements in the path.
