# Bug Check 0x1D4: UCMUCSI\_LIVEDUMP  

The UCMUCSI_LIVEDUMP live dump has a value of 0x000001D4. This indicates that the UcmUcsi class extension has encountered an error. For example this can be because a UCSI command has timed out, or because a UCSI command execution failed because the client driver returned failure.

The UcmUcsiCx.sys is the included UCSI Class Extension. For more information, see [USB Type-C Connector System Software Interface (UCSI) driver](../usbcon/ucsi.md).

(This code can never be used for a real bug check; it is used to identify live dumps.)

## UCMUCSI\_LIVEDUMP Parameters

Parameter | Description
|---------|--------------|
1 | Type of failure - see values below
2 | The UCSI command value.
3 | If non-zero, the pointer to additional information. Use `dt UcmUcsiCx!UCMUCSICX_TRIAGE` to display.
4 | Reserved.

**Type of Failure**

0x0 : A UCSI command has timed out because the firmware did not respond to the command in time.

0x1 : A UCSI command execution failed either because the client driver returned failure or because the firmware returned an error code.
