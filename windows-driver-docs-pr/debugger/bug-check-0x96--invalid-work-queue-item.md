## Cause

The INVALID\_WORK\_QUEUE\_ITEM bug check occurs when **KeRemoveQueue** removes a queue entry whose **flink** or **blink** field is **NULL**.

Any queue misuse can cause this error. But typically this error occurs because worker thread work items are misused.

An entry on a queue can be inserted on the list only one time. When an item is removed from a queue, its **flink** field is set to **NULL**. Then, when this item is removed the second time, this bug check occurs.

In most situations, the queue that is being referenced is an **ExWorkerQueue** (executive worker queue). To help identify the driver that caused the error, Parameter 4 displays the address of the worker routine that would have been called if this work item had been valid. However, if the queue that is being referenced is not an **ExWorkerQueue**, this parameter is not useful.
