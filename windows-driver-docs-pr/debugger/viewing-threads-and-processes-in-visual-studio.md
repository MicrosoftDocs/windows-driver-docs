# Controlling Threads and Processes in Visual Studio


The procedures shown in this topic require that you have the Windows Driver Kit integrated into Visual Studio. To get the integrated environment, first install Microsoft Visual Studio, and then install the Windows Driver Kit (WDK). For more information, see [Windows Driver Development](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff557573).

To open the Threads Window in Visual Studio, from the **Debug** menu, choose **Windows&gt;Threads**.
