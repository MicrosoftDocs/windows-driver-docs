# Setting Up Debugging (Kernel-Mode and User-Mode)

- After you set up kernel-mode debugging, you can use **WinDbg**, or **KD** to establish a debugging session.
- After you set up user-mode debugging, you can use **WinDbg**, **CDB**, or **NTSD** to establish a debugging session.

**Note**  The Windows debuggers are included in Debugging Tools for Windows. These debuggers are different from the Visual Studio debugger, which is included with Visual Studio. For more information, see [Windows Debugging](index.md).
