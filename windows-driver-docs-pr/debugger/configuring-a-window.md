# Configuring a Window

Each debugging information window has a shortcut menu that you can access by right-clicking the title bar of the window or by clicking the icon near the upper-right corner of the title bar. You can use the commands on this shortcut menu to configure the window.

Many debugging information windows also have toolbars that contain buttons. Most of these buttons have features that are the same as commands on the shortcut menu.
