**To open the Global Flags dialog box**

-   Double-click the **gflags.exe** icon or, at the command line, or in the **Run** dialog box, type **gflags** (without parameters).

-   - OR

-   Click **Start**, point to **All Programs**, point to **Debugging Tools for Windows,** and then click **Global Flags**.

    On Windows Vista, click **Start**, click **All Programs**, click **Debugging Tools for Windows**, right-click **Global Flags** and then click **Run as administrator**. If you omit this step, Windows displays the **System Registry Gflags Error: 5**. The Gflags dialog box opens, but Gflags commands fail.
