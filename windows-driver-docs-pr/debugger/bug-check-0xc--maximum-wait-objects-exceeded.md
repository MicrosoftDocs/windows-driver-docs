## MAXIMUM\_WAIT\_OBJECTS\_EXCEEDED Parameters


None

## Cause

This bug check results from the improper use of **KeWaitForMultipleObjects** or **FsRtlCancellableWaitForMultipleObjects**.

The caller may pass a pointer to a buffer in this routine's *WaitBlockArray* parameter. The system will use this buffer to keep track of wait objects.

If a buffer is supplied, the *Count* parameter may not exceed MAXIMUM\_WAIT\_OBJECTS. If no buffer is supplied, the *Count* parameter may not exceed THREAD\_WAIT\_OBJECTS.

If the value of *Count* exceeds the allowable value, this bug check is issued.
