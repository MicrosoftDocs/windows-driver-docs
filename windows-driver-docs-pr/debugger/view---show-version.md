# View | Show Version


## <span id="ddk_view_show_version_dbg"></span><span id="DDK_VIEW_SHOW_VERSION_DBG"></span>


Click **Show Version** on the **View** menu to display version information about the debugger and all loaded extension DLLs. This information is displayed in the [Debugger Command window](debugger-command-window.md).

This command is equivalent to pressing CTRL+ALT+W (and pressing CTRL+W in KD).

This command has the same effect as the [**version (Show Debugger Version)**](version--show-debugger-version-.md) command, except that the latter command also displays the version of the Microsoft Windows operating system.
