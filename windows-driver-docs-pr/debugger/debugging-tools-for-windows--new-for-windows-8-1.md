# Debugging Tools for Windows: New for Windows 8.1


For Windows 8.1, Debugging Tools for Windows includes these new features.

-   [GPIO Extensions](gpio-extensions.md)
-   [HID Extensions](hid-extensions.md)
-   Most of the [Kernel-Mode Driver Framework extension commands](kernel-mode-driver-framework-extensions--wdfkd-dll-.md) now work with UMDF 2 as well as KMDF. Some commands (for example [**!wdfkd.wdfumdevstacks**](-wdfkd-wdfumdevstacks.md)) that specifically support UMDF 2 have been added to this set.
-   Paging file can now be included in a CAB file along with a memory dump file. See [CAB Files that Contain Paging Files Along with a Memory Dump](cab-files-that-contain-paging-files-along-with-a-memory-dump.md)
