# Debugging Using CDB and NTSD


This section describes how to perform basic debugging tasks using the Microsoft Console Debugger (CDB) and Microsoft NT Symbolic Debugger (NTSD).

CDB and NTSD are identical in every way, except that NTSD spawns a new text window when it is started, whereas CDB inherits the Command Prompt window from which it was invoked. The instructions in this section are given for CDB, but they work equally well for NTSD. For a discussion of when to use CDB or NTSD, see [Debugging Environments](debuggers-in-the-debugging-tools-for-windows-package.md).

Details are given in the following topics:
