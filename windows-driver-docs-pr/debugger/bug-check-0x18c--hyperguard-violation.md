## Cause

This bugcheck is generated when the kernel detects that critical kernel code or data have been corrupted. There are generally three causes for a corruption:

1) A driver has inadvertently or deliberately modified critical kernel code or data. 

2) A developer attempted to set a normal kernel breakpoint using a kernel debugger that was not attached when the system was booted. Normal breakpoints,
 "bp", can only be set if the debugger is attached at boot time. Hardware breakpoints, "ba", can be set at any time.

3) A hardware corruption occurred, e.g. failing RAM holding kernel code or data.
