Click **Go** on the **Debug** menu to resume (or begin) execution on the target. This execution will continue until a breakpoint is reached, an exception or event occurs, the process ends, or the debugger breaks into the target.

This command is equivalent to pressing F5 or clicking the **Go (F5)** button (![screen shot of the go button](images/tbgo.png)) on the toolbar.
