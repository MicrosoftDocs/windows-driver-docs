# Bug Check 0x103: MUP\_FILE\_SYSTEM


The MUP\_FILE\_SYSTEM bug check has a value of 0x00000103. This bug check indicates that the multiple UNC provider (MUP) has encountered invalid or unexpected data. As a result, the MUP cannot channel a remote file system request to a network redirector, the Universal Naming Convention (UNC) provider.

<p>This bug check occurs only when you are using a Checked Build of Windows and should only be caused by file system filter drivers that are attached to legacy network redirectors. Checked builds were available on older versions of Windows before Windows 10, version 1803. Legacy redirectors use <strong>FsRtlRegisterUncProvider</strong> to register with MUP. This bug check detects filter drivers that return an NTSTATUS that is not STATUS_SUCCESS in IRP_MJ_CLEANUP or IRP_MJ_CLOSE requests.</p></td>

## Remarks

The MUP maintains context information on a per-file object basis for all file objects it handles.
