# Requesting Special Pool by Allocation Size

You can request special pool for allocations within a specified size range.

In Windows Vista and later versions of Windows, you can also use the command line to request special pool by pool tag. For information, see [**GFlags Commands**](gflags-commands.md).

**Note**   This method is rarely useful for diagnosing driver errors, because it affects all kernel pool requests of the specified size, regardless of which driver or kernel module requested the allocation.

1.  Select the **System Registry** tab or the **Kernel Flags** tab.

    On Windows Vista and later versions of Windows, this option is available on both tabs. On earlier versions of Windows, it is available only on the **System Registry** tab.

2.  In the **Kernel Special Pool Tag** section, click **Hex**, and then type a number in hexadecimal format that represents a range of sizes. All allocations within this size range will be allocated from special pool. This number must be less than PAGE\_SIZE.

3.  Click **Apply**.

    The following screen shot shows an allocation size entered as a hexadecimal value.
