# Monitoring Events


## <span id="ddk_monitoring_events_dbx"></span><span id="DDK_MONITORING_EVENTS_DBX"></span>


For an overview of events in the [debugger engine](introduction.md#debugger-engine), see [Events](events.md).

Events occurring in a target or the debugger engine may be monitored using the [IDebugEventCallbacks](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/dbgeng/nn-dbgeng-idebugeventcallbacks) interface. An **IDebugEventCallbacks** object may be registered with a client using [*SetEventCallbacks*](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/dbgeng/nf-dbgeng-idebugclient5-seteventcallbacks). Each client can only have at most one **IDebugEventCallbacks** object registered with it.

When an **IDebugEventCallbacks** object is registered with a client, the engine will call the object's [**IDebugEventCallbacks::GetInterestMask**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/dbgeng/nf-dbgeng-idebugeventcallbacks-getinterestmask) to determine which events the object is interested in. Only events in which the object is interested will be sent to it.

For each type of event, the engine calls a corresponding callback method on [IDebugEventCallbacks](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/dbgeng/nn-dbgeng-idebugeventcallbacks). For events from the target, the [**DEBUG\_STATUS\_XXX**](./debug-status-xxx.md) value returned from these calls specifies how the execution of the target should proceed. The engine collects these return values from each **IDebugEventCallbacks** object it calls and acts on the one with the highest precedence.

The following events break into the debugger by default:

-   Breakpoint Events

-   Exception Events (not documented here)

-   System Error

The following events do not break into the debugger by default:

-   Create Process Event

-   Exit Process Event

-   Create Thread Event

-   Exit Thread Event

-   Load Module Event

-   Unload Module Event

### <span id="internal_engine_changes"></span><span id="INTERNAL_ENGINE_CHANGES"></span>Internal Engine Changes

The following are not actual events, but are merely internal engine changes:

-   Target Change

-   Engine Change

-   Engine Symbol Change

-   Session Status Change
