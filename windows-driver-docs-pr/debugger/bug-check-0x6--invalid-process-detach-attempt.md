# Bug Check 0x6: INVALID\_PROCESS\_DETACH\_ATTEMPT


The INVALID\_PROCESS\_DETACH\_ATTEMPT bug check has a value of 0x00000006.

This bug check appears very infrequently. This bug check can be caused by calling theÂ [**KeStackAttachProcess**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ntifs/nf-ntifs-kestackattachprocess) routine and subsequently calling [**KeUnstackDetachProcess**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ntifs/nf-ntifs-keunstackdetachprocess) in the driver's implementation of the [**PLOAD_IMAGE_NOTIFY_ROUTINE**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ntddk/nc-ntddk-pload_image_notify_routine) callback function. The callback runs in a thread of the process in which the image loaded.
