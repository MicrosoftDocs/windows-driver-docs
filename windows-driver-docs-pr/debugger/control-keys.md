# Control Keys


## <span id="ddk_control_keys_dbg"></span><span id="DDK_CONTROL_KEYS_DBG"></span>


This section of the reference discusses the various control keys that can be used in the debuggers.

These control keys work in KD and, in some cases, CDB. Many of these also work in WinDbg (using the CTRL+ALT keys instead of just CTRL).

WinDbg also uses the CTRL key, the ALT key, and the F keys as shortcut keys to toggle the menu options. See [Shortcut Keys](keyboard-shortcuts.md) for a list of their meanings.
