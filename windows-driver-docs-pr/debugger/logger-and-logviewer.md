# Logger and LogViewer

The *Logger* and *LogViewer* tools provide an alternative to standard user-mode debugging. Logger can monitor the actions of a user-mode target application and record all of its API calls. The resulting information can be displayed in the debugger, saved as a text file, or displayed in a powerful interactive format by the LogViewer tool..
