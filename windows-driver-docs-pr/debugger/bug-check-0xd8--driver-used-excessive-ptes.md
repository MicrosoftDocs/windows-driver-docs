If the driver responsible for the error can be identified, its name is printed on the blue screen and stored in memory at the location (PUNICODE\_STRING) **KiBugCheckDriver**.

## Cause

This is usually caused by a driver not cleaning up its memory use properly. Parameter 1 shows the driver which has consumed the most PTEs. The call stack will reveal which driver actually caused the bug check.

## Resolution

Both drivers may need to be fixed. The total number of system PTEs may also need to be increased.
