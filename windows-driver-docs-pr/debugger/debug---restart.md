Click **Restart** on the **Debug** menu to stop the target's execution and end the target process and all its threads. This command then restarts the target execution at the beginning of the process.

This command is equivalent to pressing CTRL+SHIFT+F5 or clicking the **Restart (Ctrl+Shift+F5)** button (![screen shot of the restart button](images/tbrestart.png)) on the toolbar.
