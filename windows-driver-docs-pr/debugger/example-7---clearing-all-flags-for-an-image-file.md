# Example 7: Clearing All Flags for an Image File

The following command clears all flags and image debugger options for an image file. The command adds high-values (0xFFFFFFFF) to the current flag value. GFlags responds by deleting the **GlobalFlag** registry entry for the image file, thereby deleting all of the values it stores.

This command does not affect flags set in the system-wide **GlobalFlag** registry entry or flags set for the session (kernel mode).

```console
gflags /i notepad.exe ffffffff 
```

In response, GFlags displays a message indicating that there are no flags set for the image file:

```console
No Registry Settings for notepad.exe executable 
```
