# Viewing and Editing Memory in CDB


## <span id="Viewing_and_Editing_Memory"></span><span id="viewing_and_editing_memory"></span><span id="VIEWING_AND_EDITING_MEMORY"></span>Viewing and Editing Memory


In CDB, you can view and edit memory by entering one of the [**Display Memory**](../debuggercmds/d--da--db--dc--dd--dd--df--dp--dq--du--dw--dw--dyb--dyd--display-memor.md) commands, and you can edit memory by entering one of the [**Enter Values**](../debuggercmds/e--ea--eb--ed--ed--ef--ep--eq--eu--ew--eza--ezu--enter-values-.md) commands. For a detailed discussion of these commands, see [Accessing Memory by Virtual Address](accessing-memory-by-virtual-address.md) and [Accessing Memory by Physical Address](accessing-memory-by-physical-address.md).

In CDB, you can view and edit global variables by entering commands. The debugger interprets the name of a global variable as a virtual address. Therefore, all of the commands that are described in [Accessing Memory by Virtual Address](accessing-memory-by-virtual-address.md) can be used to read or write global variables. For additional information about viewing and editing global variables, see [Accessing Global Variables](accessing-global-variables.md).

In CDB you can view and edit local variables by entering commands. The debugger interprets the name of a local variable as an address. Therefore, all of the commands that are described in [Accessing Memory by Virtual Address](accessing-memory-by-virtual-address.md) can be used to read or write local variables. However, if it is necessary to indicate to a command that a symbol is local, precede the symbol with a dollar sign ( $ ) and an exclamation point ( ! ), as in `$!var`. For additional information about viewing and editing local variables, see [Accessing Local Variables](accessing-local-variables.md).
