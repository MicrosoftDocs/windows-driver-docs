# Bug Check 0x169: CLUSTER\_CSV\_VOLUME\_ARRIVAL\_LIVEDUMP

The CLUSTER\_CSV\_VOLUME\_ARRIVAL\_LIVEDUMP live dump has a value of 0x00000169. This indicates that Cluster Shared Volume Manager was asked to create a new volume device object, and volume has not arrived in time.

## CLUSTER\_CSV\_VOLUME\_ARRIVAL\_LIVEDUMP Parameters

|Parameter|Description|
|--- |--- |
|1| Cluster Service PID. |
|2| Reserved.|

|4| Reserved.|


## Cause

The Cluster Shared Volume Manager was asked to create a new volume device object, and volume has not arrived in time.

The system generated a live dump for analysis of the delay.
