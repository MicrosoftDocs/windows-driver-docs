# Bug Check 0x117: VIDEO\_TDR\_TIMEOUT\_DETECTED

The VIDEO\_TDR\_TIMEOUT\_DETECTED live dump has a value of 0x00000117. This indicates that the display driver failed to respond in a timely fashion.

(This code can never be used for a real bug check; it is used to identify live dumps.)

## Cause

A common stability problem in graphics occurs when the system appears completely frozen or hung while processing an end-user command or operation. Usually the GPU is busy processing intensive graphics operations, typically during game-play. No screen updates occur, and users assume that their system is frozen. Users usually wait a few seconds and then reboot the system by pressing the power button. Windows tries to detect these problematic hang situations and dynamically recover a responsive desktop.

This process of detection and recovery is known as Timeout Detection and Recovery (TDR). The default timeout is 2 seconds. In the TDR process for video cards, the operating system's GPU scheduler calls the display miniport driver's [*DxgkDdiResetFromTimeout*](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dkmddi/nc-d3dkmddi-dxgkddi_resetfromtimeout) function to reinitialize the driver and reset the GPU.

If the recovery process is successful, a message will be displayed, indicating that the "Display driver stopped responding and has recovered."

For more information, see Timeout Detection and Recovery (TDR), [TDR Registry Keys](../display/tdr-registry-keys.md) and [TDR changes in Windows 8](../display/tdr-changes-in-windows-8.md) which are located in [Timeout Detection and Recovery (TDR)](../display/timeout-detection-and-recovery.md)

## Resolution

The GPU is taking more time than permitted to display graphics to your monitor. This behavior can occur for one or more of the following reasons:

-   You may need to install the latest updates for your display driver, so that it properly supports the TDR process.
-   Hardware issues that impact the ability of the video card to operate properly, including:
    -   Over-clocked components, such as the motherboard
    -   Incorrect component compatibility and settings (especially memory configuration and timings)
    -   Insufficient system cooling
    -   Insufficient system power
    -   Defective parts (memory modules, motherboards, etc.)
-   Visual effects, or too many programs running in the background may be slowing your PC down so that the video card can not respond as necessary.

The [**!analyze**](../debuggercmds/-analyze.md) debug extension displays information about the bug check and can be helpful in determining the root cause.

```dbgcmd

You can also set a breakpoint in the code leading up to this stop code and attempt to single step forward into the faulting code, if you can consistently reproduce the stop code.

For more information see the following topics:

[Crash dump analysis using the Windows debuggers (WinDbg)](crash-dump-files.md)

If you are not equipped to use the Windows debugger to work on this problem, you can use some basic troubleshooting techniques.

-   Check the System Log in Event Viewer for additional error messages that might help identify the device or driver that is causing this bug check.

-   If a driver is identified in the bug check message, disable the driver or check with the manufacturer for driver updates.

-   Verify that all graphics related software such as DirectX and OpenGL are up to date, and any graphics intensive applications (such as games) are fully patched.
-   Confirm that any new hardware that is installed is compatible with the installed version of Windows. For example, you can get information about required hardware at [Windows 10 Specifications](https://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-10-specifications).

-   **Using Safe Mode**

    Consider using Safe Mode to help isolate this issue. Using Safe Mode loads only the minimum required drivers and system services during the Windows startup. To enter Safe Mode, use **Update and Security** in Settings. Select **Recovery**-&gt;**Advanced startup** to boot to maintenance mode. At the resulting menu, choose **Troubleshoot**-&gt; **Advanced Options** -&gt; **Startup Settings** -&gt; **Restart**. After Windows restarts to the **Startup Settings** screen, select option, 4, 5 or 6 to boot to Safe Mode.

    Safe Mode may be available by pressing a function key on boot, for example F8. Refer to information from the manufacturer for specific startup options.

-   Run the Windows Memory Diagnostics tool, to test the memory. In the control panel search box, type Memory, and then select **Diagnose your computer's memory problems**.â€Œ After the test is run, use Event viewer to view the results under the System log. Look for the *MemoryDiagnostics-Results* entry to view the results.

-   You can try running the hardware diagnostics supplied by the system manufacturer.

-   For additional general troubleshooting information, see [**Blue Screen Data**](blue-screen-data.md).

## Remarks

**Hardware certification requirements**

For information on requirements that hardware devices must meet when they implement TDR, refer to the WHCK documentation on *Device.Graphicsâ€¦TDRResiliency*.
