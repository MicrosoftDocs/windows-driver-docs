# Native Debugger Objects in JavaScript Extensions - Debugger Object Details

This topic describes additional details about using the native debugger objects in JavaScript extensions.

Native debugger objects represent various constructs and behaviors of the debugger environment. The objects can be passed into (or acquired in) JavaScript extensions to manipulate the state of the debugger.

For information about Debugger object JavaScript extensions, see [Native Debugger Objects in JavaScript Extensions](native-objects-in-javascript-extensions.md).

For general information about working with JavaScript, see [JavaScript Debugger Scripting](javascript-debugger-scripting.md).

For example JavaScript scripts and extensions, the debugger team hosts a GitHub repo at https://github.com/Microsoft/WinDbg-Samples.

**Passing Native Objects**

Debugger objects can be passed into or acquired in JavaScript extensions in a variety of ways.

-   They can be passed to JavaScript functions or methods
-   They can be the instance object for a JavaScript prototype (as a visualizer, for instance)
-   They can be returned from host methods designed to create native debugger objects
-   They can be returned from host methods designed to create debugger native objects

Debugger objects that are passed to a JavaScript extension have a set of functionality that is described in this section.

-   Property Access
-   Projected Names
-   Special Types Pertaining to Native Debugger Objects
-   Additional Attributes

**Property Access**

While there are some properties on objects which are placed there by the JavaScript provider itself, the majority of properties on a native object which enters JavaScript are provided by the data model. This means that for a property access --- object.propertyName or object\[propertyName\], the following will occur.

-   If *propertyName* is the name of a property projected onto the object by the JavaScript provider itself, it will resolve to this first; otherwise
-   If *propertyName* is the name of a key projected onto the object by the data model (another Visualizer), it will resolve to this name second; otherwise
-   If *propertyName* is the name of a field of the native object, it will resolve to this name third; otherwise
-   If object is a pointer, the pointer will be dereferenced, and the cycle above will continue (a projected property of the dereferenced object followed by a key followed by a native field)

The normal means of property access in JavaScript -- object.propertyName and object\[propertyName\] -- will access the underlying native fields of an object, much as the 'dx' command would within the debugger.

**Projected Names**

The following properties (and methods) are projected onto native objects which enter JavaScript.

| Method             | Signature                  | Description                                                                                                                                |
|--------------------|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| hostContext        | Property                   | Returns an object which represents the context the object is within (the address space, debug target, etc...)                              |
| targetLocation     | Property                   | Returns an object which is an abstraction of where the object is within an address space (virtual address, register, sub-register, etc...) |
| targetSize         | Property                   | Returns the size of the object (effectively: sizeof(&lt;TYPE OF OBJECT&gt;)                                                                |
| addParentModel     | .addParentModel(object)    | Adds a new parent model (akin to a JavaScript prototype but on the data model side) to the object                                          |
| removeParentModel  | .removeParentModel(object) | Removes a given parent model from the object                                                                                               |
| runtimeTypedObject | Property                   | Performs analysis on the object and tries to convert it to the runtime (most derived) type                                                 |
| targetType         | Property                   | JavaScript extensions have direct access to the type system of the underlying language. This access is expressed through the notion of type objects. For more information, see [Native Debugger Objects in JavaScript Extensions - Type Objects](native-objects-in-javascript-extensions-type-objects.md)  |

If the object is a pointer, the following properties (and methods) are projected onto the pointer which enters JavaScript:

| Property Name | Signature      | Description                                                                    |
|---------------|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| add           | .add(value)    | Performs pointer math addition between the pointer and the specified value     |
| address       | Property       | Returns the address of the pointer as a 64-bit ordinal object (a library type) |
| dereference   | .dereference() | Dereferences the pointer and returns the underlying object                     |
| isNull        | Property       | Returns whether or not the pointer value is nullptr (0)                        |

**Special Types Pertaining to Native Debugger Objects**

**Location Objects**

The location object which is returned from the targetLocation property of a native object contains the following properties (and methods).

| Property Name | Signature        | Description                                          |
|---------------|------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| add           | .add(value)      | Adds an absolute byte offset to the location.        |
| subtract      | .subtract(value) | Subtracts an absolute byte offset from the location. |

**Additional Attributes**

**Iterability**

Any object which is understood as iterable by the data model (it is a native array or it has a visualizer (NatVis or otherwise) which makes it iterable) will have an iterator function (indexed via the ES6 standard Symbol.iterator) placed upon it. This means that you can iterate a native object in JavaScript as follows.

```javascript
function iterateNative(nativeObject)
{
    for (var val of nativeObject)
    {
        // 
        // val will contain each element iterated from the native object.  This would be each element of an array,
        // each element of an STL structure which is made iterable through NatVis, each element of a data structure
        // which has a JavaScript iterator accessible via [Symbol.iterator], or each element of something
        // which is made iterable via support of IIterableConcept in C/C++.
        //
    }
}
```

**Indexability**

Objects which are understood as indexable in one dimension via ordinals (e.g.: native arrays) will be indexable in JavaScript via the standard property access operator -- object\[index\]. If an object is indexable by name or is indexable in more than one dimension, the getValueAt and setValueAt methods will be projected onto the object so that JavaScript code can utilize the indexer.

```javascript
function indexNative(nativeArray)
{
    var first = nativeArray[0];
}
```

**String Conversion**

Any native object which has a display string conversion via support of IStringDisplayableConcept or a NatVis DisplayString element will have that string conversion accessible via the standard JavaScript toString method.

```javascript
function stringifyNative(nativeObject)
{
    var myString = nativeObject.toString();
}
```

As mentioned, a JavaScript script can get access to native objects by having them passed into JavaScript in one of several ways or it can create them through calls to the host library. Use the following functions to create native debugger objects.

## <span id="Host-APIs"></span><span id="host-apis"></span><span id="HOST-APIS"></span>Host APIs for JavaScript Extensions

The JavaScript provider inserts an object called host into the global namespace of every script which it loads. This object provides access to critical functionality for the script as well as access to the namespace of the debugger. It is set up in two phases.

-   **Phase 1**: Before any script executes, the host object only contains the minimal set of functionality necessary for a script to initialize itself and register its extensibility points (both as producer and consumer). The root and initialization code is not intended to manipulate the state of a debug target or perform complex operations and, as such, the host is not fully populated until after the initializeScript method returns.

-   **Phase 2**: After initializeScript returns, the host object is populated with everything necessary to manipulate the state of debug targets.

**Host Object Level**

A few key pieces of functionality are directly under the host object. The remainder are sub-namespaced. Namespaces include the following.

| Namespace   | Description                                                              |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| diagnostics | Functionality to assist in the diagnosis and debugging of script code    |
| memory      | Functionality to enable memory reading and writing within a debug target |

**Root Level**

Directly within the host object, the following properties, methods, and constructors can be found.

**Diagnostics Functionality**

The diagnostics sub-namespace of the host object contains the following.

| Name     | Signature           | Phase Present | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|----------|---------------------|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| debugLog | debugLog(object...) | 1             | This provides printf style debugging to a script extension. At present, output from debugLog is routed to the output console of the debugger. At a later point in time, there are plans to provide flexibility on routing this output. NOTE: This should not be used as a means of printing user output to console. It may not be routed there in the future. |

**Memory Functionality**

The memory sub-namespace of the host object contains the following.

<td align="left">This reads a raw array of values from the address space of the debug target and places a typed array on top of the view of this memory. The supplied location can be an address (a 64-bit value), a location object, or a native pointer. The size of the array is indicated by the <em>numElements</em> argument. The size (and type) of each element of the array is given by the optional <em>elementSize</em> and <em>isSigned</em> arguments. If no such arguments are supplied, the default is byte (unsigned / 1 byte). If the optional <em>contextInheritor</em> argument is supplied, memory will be read in the context (e.g.: address space and debug target) indicated by the argument; otherwise, it will be read from the debugger's current context. Note that using this method on 8, 16, and 32-bit values results in a fast typed view being placed over the read memory. Using this method on 64-bit values results in an array of 64-bit library types being constructed which is significantly more expensive!</td>

**Data Model Mapping**

The following data model concepts map to JavaScript.

| Concept                 | Native Interface             | JavaScript Equivalent                                                |
|-------------------------|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| String Conversion       | IStringDisplayableConcept    | standard: toString(...){...}                                         |
| Iterability             | IIterableConcept             | standard: \[Symbol.iterator\](){...}                                 |
| Indexability            | IIndexableConcept            | protocol: getDimensionality(...) / getValueAt(...) / setValueAt(...) |
| Runtime Type Conversion | IPreferredRuntimeTypeConcept | protocol: getPreferredRuntimeTypedObject(...)                        |

**String Conversion**

The string conversion concept (IStringDisplayableConcept) directly translates to the standard JavaScript **toString** method. As all JavaScript objects have a string conversion (provided by Object.prototype if not provided elsewhere), every JavaScript object returned to the data model can be converted to a display string. Overriding the string conversion simply requires implementing your own toString.

```javascript
class myObject
{
    //
    // This method will be called whenever any native code calls IStringDisplayableConcept::ToDisplayString(...)
    //
    toString()
    { 
        return "This is my own string conversion!";
    }
}
```

**Iterability**

The data model's concept of whether an object is iterable or not maps directly to the ES6 protocol of whether an object is iterable. Any object which has a \[Symbol.iterator\] method is considered iterable. Implementation of such will make the object iterable.

An object which is only iterable can have an implementation such as follows.

```javascript
class myObject
{
    //
    // This method will be called whenever any native code calls IIterableConcept::GetIterator
    //
    *[Symbol.iterator]()
    {
        yield "First Value";
        yield "Second Value";
        yield "Third Value";
    }
}
```

Special consideration must be given for objects which are both iterable and indexable as the objects returned from the iterator must include the index as well as the value via a special return type.

**Iterable and Indexable**

An object which is iterable and indexable requires a special return value from the iterator. Instead of yielding the values, the iterator yields instances of indexedValue. The indicies are passed as an array in the second argument to the indexedValue constructor. They can be multi-dimensional but must match the dimensionality returned in the indexer protocol.

This code shows an example implementaion.

```javascript
class myObject
{
    //
    // This method will be called whenever any native code calls IIterableConcept::GetIterator
    //
    *[Symbol.iterator]()
    {
        //
        // Consider this a map which mapped 42->"First Value", 99->"Second Value", and 107->"Third Value"
        //
        yield new host.indexedValue("First Value", [42]);
        yield new host.indexedValue("Second Value", [99]);
        yield new host.indexedValue("Third Value", [107]);
    }
}
```

**Indexability**

Unlike JavaScript, the data model makes a very explicit differentiation between property access and indexing. Any JavaScript object which wishes to present itself as indexable in the data model must implement a protocol consisting of a getDimensionality method which returns the dimensionality of the indexer and an optional pair of getValueAt and setValueAt methods which perform reads and writes of the object at supplied indicies. It is acceptable to omit either the getValueAt or setValueAt methods if the object is read-only or write-only

```javascript
class myObject
{
    //
    // This method will be called whenever any native code calls IIndexableConcept::GetDimensionality or IIterableConcept::GetDefaultIndexDimensionality
    //
    getDimensionality()
    {
        //
        // Pretend we are a two dimensional array.
        //
        return 2;
    } 

    //
    // This method will be called whenever any native code calls IIndexableConcept::GetAt
    //
    getValueAt(row, column)
    {
        return this.__values[row * this.__columnCount + column];
    }

    //
    // This method will be called whenever any native code calls IIndexableConcept::SetAt
    //
    setValueAt(value, row, column)
    {
        this.__values[row * this.__columnCount + column] = value;
    }
}
```

**Runtime Type Conversion**

This is only relevant for JavaScript prototypes/classes which are registered against type system (native) types. The debugger is often capable of performing analysis (e.g. Run-Time Type Information (RTTI) / v-table analysis) to determine the true runtime type of an object from a static type expressed in code. A data model registered against a native type can override this behavior via an implementation of the IPreferredRuntimeTypeConcept. Likewise, a JavaScript class or prototype registered against a native object can provide its own implementation via implementation of a protocol consisting of the getPreferredRuntimeTypedObject method.

Note that while this method can technically return anything, it is considered bad form for it to return something which isn't really the runtime type or a derived type. Such can result in significant confusion for users of the debugger. Overriding this method can, however, be valuable for things such as C-style header+object styles of implementation, etc...

```javascript
class myNativeModel
{
    //
    // This method will be called whenever the data model calls IPreferredRuntimeTypeConcept::CastToPreferredRuntimeType
    //
    getPreferredRuntimeTypedObject()
    {
        var loc = this.targetLocation;

        //
        // Perform analysis...
        //
        var runtimeLoc = loc.Add(runtimeObjectOffset);
  
        return host.createTypedObject(runtimeLoc, runtimeModule, runtimeTypeName);
    }
}
```
