**Parameter 1 is equal to 0x6**

If Parameter 1 is equal to 0x6, then a fatal error was made in handling a WDF request. In this case, Parameter 2 further specifies the type of fatal error that has been made, as defined by the enumeration WDF\_REQUEST\_FATAL\_ERROR.

**Parameter 1 is equal to 0xB**

If Parameter 1 is equal to 0xB, then an attempt to acquire or release a lock was invalid. In this case, Parameter 3 further specifies the error that has been made.

## Cause

See the description of each code in the Parameters section for an explanation of the cause.

## Resolution

The [**!analyze**](../debuggercmds/-analyze.md) debug extension displays information about the bug check and can be helpful in gathering information, such as the faulting code module.

Typically, the WDF dump file will yield further information on the driver that caused this bug check. Use this command to look at the log file.

```dbgcmd
kd> !wdfkd.wdflogdump <WDF_Driver_Name>
```

If Parameter 1 is equal to **0x2**, examine the caller's stack to determine the lock in question.

If Parameter 1 is equal to **0x3**, the driver's Kernel-Mode Driver Framework error log will include details about the outstanding references.

If Parameter 1 is equal to **0x4**, use the [**ln debugger**](../debuggercmds/ln--list-nearest-symbols-.md) command with the value of *Parameter 3* as its argument to determine which function requires a non-**NULL** parameter.

If Parameter 1 is equal to **0x7**, use the **!wdfkd.wdfhandle***Parameter 2* extension command to determine the handle type.

If Parameter 1 is equal to **0xA**, then the WDF\_QUEUE\_FATAL\_ERROR\_DATA structure will indicate either the problematic request or the queue handle. It will also indicate the NTSTATUS, if not STATUS\_SUCCESS, when available.
