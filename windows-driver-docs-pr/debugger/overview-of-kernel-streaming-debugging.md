# Overview of Kernel Streaming Debugging


Kernel streaming debugging extensions can be found in the extension module Ks.dll.

You can use Ks.dll to help debug KS, AVStream, port class and stream class drivers.

For a complete list of the extension commands in Ks.dll, see [Kernel Streaming Extensions (Ks.dll)](../debuggercmds/kernel-streaming-extensions--ks-dll-.md).

If you wish to use these extensions with Windows 2000, you must copy Ks.dll from the kdexts directory to the w2kfre directory.
