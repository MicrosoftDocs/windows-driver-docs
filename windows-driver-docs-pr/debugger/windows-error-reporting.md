# Windows Error Reporting


Windows Error Reporting (WER) is included in Windows Vista and later versions of Windows. You can configure WER to write user-mode dump files when exceptions and other errors occur in user-mode code. For more information, see [Enabling Postmortem Debugging](enabling-postmortem-debugging.md) and [Collecting User-Mode Dumps](/windows/win32/wer/collecting-user-mode-dumps).

WER replaced Dr. Watson, which was included in Windows XP.
