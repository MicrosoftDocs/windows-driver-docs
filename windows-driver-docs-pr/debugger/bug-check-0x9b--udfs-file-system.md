## Cause

The UDFS\_FILE\_SYSTEM bug check might be caused disk corruption. Corruption in the file system or bad blocks (sectors) on the disk can induce this error. Corrupted SCSI and IDE drivers can also adversely affect the system's ability to read and write to the disk and cause the error.

This bug check might also occur if nonpaged pool memory is full. If the nonpaged pool memory is full, this error can stop the system. However, during the indexing process, if the amount of available nonpaged pool memory is very low, another kernel-mode driver that requires nonpaged pool memory can also trigger this error.

## Resolution

**To debug this problem:** Use the [**.cxr (Display Context Record)**](../debuggercmds/-cxr--display-context-record-.md) command with Parameter 3, and then use [**kb (Display Stack Backtrace)**](../debuggercmds/k--kb--kc--kd--kp--kp--kv--display-stack-backtrace-.md).

**To resolve a disk corruption problem:** Check Event Viewer for error messages from SCSI and FASTFAT (System Log) or Autochk (Application Log) that might help identify the device or driver that is causing the error. Disable any virus scanners, backup application, or disk defragmenter tools that continually monitor the system. You should also run hardware diagnostics that the system manufacturer supplies. For more information about these procedures, see the owner's manual for your computer. Run **Chkdsk /f /r** to detect and resolve any file system structural corruption. You must restart the system before the disk scan begins on a system partition.

**To resolve a nonpaged pool memory depletion problem:** Add new physical memory to the computer. This memory increases the quantity of nonpaged pool memory that is available to the kernel.
