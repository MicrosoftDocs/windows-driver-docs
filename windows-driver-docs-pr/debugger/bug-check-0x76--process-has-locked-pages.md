# Bug Check 0x76: PROCESS\_HAS\_LOCKED\_PAGES


The PROCESS\_HAS\_LOCKED\_PAGES bug check has a value of 0x00000076. This bug check indicates that a driver failed to release locked pages after an I/O operation, or that it attempted to unlock pages that were already unlocked.

## Cause

The driver either failed to unlock pages that it locked (parameter 1 value is 0x0), or the driver is attempting to unlock pages that have not been locked or that have already been unlocked (parameter 1 value is 0x1).

## Resolution

The [**!analyze**](../debuggercmds/-analyze.md) debug extension displays information about the bug check and can be helpful in determining the root cause.

**If the parameter 1 value is 0x0**

First use the [**!search**](../debuggercmds/-search.md) extension on the current process pointer throughout all of physical memory. This extension might find at least one memory descriptor list (MDL) that points to the current process. Next, use **!search** on each MDL that you find to obtain the I/O request packet (IRP) that points to the current process. From this IRP, you can identify which driver is leaking the pages.

Otherwise, you can detect which driver caused the error by editing the registry:

1.  In the **\\\\HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Session Manager\\Memory Management** registry key, create or edit the **TrackLockedPages** value, and then set it equal to DWORD 1.

2.  Restart the computer.

The system then saves stack traces, so you can easily identify the driver that caused the problem. If the driver causes the same error again, [**bug check 0xCB**](bug-check-0xcb--driver-left-locked-pages-in-process.md) (DRIVER\_LEFT\_LOCKED\_PAGES\_IN\_PROCESS) is issued, and the name of the driver that causes this error is displayed on the blue screen and stored in memory at the location (PUNICODE\_STRING) **KiBugCheckDriver**.

**If the parameter 1 value is 0x1**

Examine the driver source code that locks and unlocks memory, and try to locate an instance where memory is unlocked without first being locked.
