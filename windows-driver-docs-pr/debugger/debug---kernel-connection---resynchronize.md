Point to **Kernel Connection** and then click **Resynchronize** on the **Debug** menu to cause the debugger to try to reestablish a kernel debugging connection with the target computer.

This command is equivalent to pressing CTRL+ALT+R. (You can also press CTRL+R in KD.)

Use this command if the target is not responding.
