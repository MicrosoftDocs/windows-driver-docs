# Debugging Tools for Windows: New for Windows 8

Beginning with Windows 8, you can develop, build, and debug both kernel-mode and user-mode components all from Microsoft Visual Studio. There is added support for debugging over a network connection or a USB 3.0 connection and improved support for debugging optimized code and inline functions. For more information, see these topics:

-   [Debugging Using Visual Studio](debugging-using-visual-studio.md)
-   [Setting Up a Network Connection Manually](setting-up-a-network-debugging-connection.md)
-   [Setting Up a USB 3.0 Connection Manually](setting-up-a-usb-3-0-debug-cable-connection.md)
-   [Debugging Optimized Code and Inline Functions](debugging-optimized-code-and-inline-functions-external.md)

Two new sets of debugger extension commands are included:

-   [USB 3.0 Extensions](usb-3-extensions.md)
-   [RCDRKD Extensions](rcdrkd-extensions.md)

In addition to Visual Studio, you can sse the Windows debugger to debug Windows apps. The Debugging Tools for Windows package includes, [**PLMDebug.exe**](plmdebug.md), that enables you to take manual control of suspending, resuming, debugging, and terminating Windows app.

Sos.dll is a component that is used for debugging managed code. The Windows 8 Debugging Tools for Windows package does not include sos.dll. For information about how to get sos.dll, see *Getting the SOS Debugging Extension (sos.dll)* in [Debugging Managed Code](debugging-managed-code.md).
