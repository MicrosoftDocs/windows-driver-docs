# Bug Check 0x167: CLUSTER\_CSV\_SNAPSHOT\_DEVICE\_INFO\_TIMEOUT\_LIVEDUMP

The CLUSTER\_CSV\_SNAPSHOT\_DEVICE\_INFO\_TIMEOUT\_LIVEDUMP live dump has a value of 0x00000167. This indicates that a Cluster Service call to the volsnap to query snapshot information took too long.

## CLUSTER\_CSV\_SNAPSHOT\_DEVICE\_INFO\_TIMEOUT\_LIVEDUMP Parameters

|Parameter|Description|
|--- |--- |
|1| Cluster Service PID.|
|2| TID of the thread that handles volsnap query.|
|3| This parameter has a value of 1 if we timeout out while CSV volume is active and 2 if we timeout out even after taking CSV volume down.|
|4| Reserved.|


## Cause

A Cluster Service call to the volsnap to query snapshot information took too long.

(This code can never be used for a real bug check; it is used to identify live dumps.)
