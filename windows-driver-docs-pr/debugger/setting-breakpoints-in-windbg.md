# Setting Breakpoints in WinDbg (Classic)


There are several ways you can set, view, and manipulate breakpoints using WinDbg.

You can set, view, and manipulate breakpoints by entering commands in the Debugger Command Window. For a list of commands, see [Methods of Controlling Breakpoints](methods-of-controlling-breakpoints.md).

## <span id="WinDbg_Menu"></span><span id="windbg_menu"></span><span id="WINDBG_MENU"></span>WinDbg Menu


You can open the **Breakpoints** dialog box by choosing **Breakpoints** from the **Edit** menu or by pressing ALT+F9. This dialog box lists all breakpoints, and you can use it to disable, enable, or clear existing breakpoints or to set new breakpoints.

## <span id="Code_Windows"></span><span id="code_windows"></span><span id="CODE_WINDOWS"></span>Code Windows


The Disassembly window and the Source windows highlight lines that have breakpoints set. Enabled breakpoints are red, and disabled breakpoints are yellow.

If you set the cursor on a specific line in the Disassembly window or in a Source window, you can press F9 to set a breakpoint at that line.
