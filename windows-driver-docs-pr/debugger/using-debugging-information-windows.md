# Using Debugging Information Windows


## <span id="ddk_using_debugging_information_windows_dbg"></span><span id="DDK_USING_DEBUGGING_INFORMATION_WINDOWS_DBG"></span>


WinDbg has ten kinds of debugging information windows. You can have only one instance of the following windows open at the same time: the [Debugger Command window](debugger-command-window.md), the Watch window, the [Locals window](locals-window.md), the [Registers window](registers-window.md), the [Calls window](calls-window.md), the [Disassembly window](disassembly-window.md), the [Processes and Threads window](processes-and-threads-window.md), and the Scratch Pad. In addition to these eight individual windows, WinDbg can display multiple [Source windows](source-window.md) and [Memory windows](memory-window.md) at the same time.

This section describes the features that are common to all of these windows:

[Opening a Window](opening-a-window.md)

[Closing a Window](closing-a-window.md)

[Configuring a Window](configuring-a-window.md)

[Moving Through a Window](moving-through-a-window.md)

[Cutting and Pasting Text](cutting-and-pasting-text.md)

[Changing Text Properties](changing-text-properties.md)

[Positioning the Windows](positioning-the-windows.md)
