Click **Cut** on the **Edit** menu to delete any text that you have selected and to move it to the clipboard.

This command is equivalent to pressing CTRL+X or SHIFT+DELETE or clicking the **Cut (Ctrl+X)** button (![screen shot of the cut button](images/tbcut.png)) on the toolbar.

You can use the **Cut** command on the **Edit** menu only with docked or tabbed windows, but you can use the shortcut keys and the toolbar button with any window that supports this feature.
