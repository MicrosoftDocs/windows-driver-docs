# HRESULT Values


The following is a list of common return values for functions and methods, and their usual meanings.

## <span id="ddk_return_values_dbx"></span><span id="DDK_RETURN_VALUES_DBX"></span>


**Successful results.** These values are defined in WinError.h.

<span id="S_OK"></span><span id="s_ok"></span>S\_OK  
Successful completion.

<span id="S_FALSE"></span><span id="s_false"></span>S\_FALSE  
Completed without error, but only partial results were obtained.

If a buffer is not large enough to hold the information that is returned to it, the returned information is often truncated to fit into the buffer and S\_FALSE is returned from the method.

**Error results.** These values are defined in WinError.h.

<span id="E_FAIL"></span><span id="e_fail"></span>E\_FAIL  
The operation could not be performed.

<span id="E_INVALIDARG"></span><span id="e_invalidarg"></span>E\_INVALIDARG  
One of the arguments passed in was invalid.

<span id="E_NOINTERFACE"></span><span id="e_nointerface"></span>E\_NOINTERFACE  
The object searched for was not found.

<span id="E_OUTOFMEMORY"></span><span id="e_outofmemory"></span>E\_OUTOFMEMORY  
A memory allocation attempt failed.

<span id="E_UNEXPECTED"></span><span id="e_unexpected"></span>E\_UNEXPECTED  
The target was not accessible, or the engine was not in a state where the function or method could be processed.

<span id="E_NOTIMPL"></span><span id="e_notimpl"></span>E\_NOTIMPL  
Not implemented.

<span id="HRESULT_FROM_WIN32_ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED_"></span><span id="hresult_from_win32_error_access_denied_"></span>HRESULT\_FROM\_WIN32(ERROR\_ACCESS\_DENIED)  
The operation was denied because the debugger is in [Secure Mode](./secure-mode.md).

**NT error results.** Other error codes, such as STATUS\_CONTROL\_C\_EXIT and STATUS\_NO\_MORE\_ENTRIES, can sometimes occur. These results are passed to the HRESULT\_FROM\_NT macro that is defined in WinError.h before being returned.

**Win32 error results.** Other error codes, such as ERROR\_READ\_FAULT and ERROR\_WRITE\_FAULT, can sometimes occur. These results are passed to the HRESULT\_FROM\_WIN32 macro that is defined in WinError.h before being returned.
