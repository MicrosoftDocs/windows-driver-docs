# Bug Check 0xC9: DRIVER\_VERIFIER\_IOMANAGER\_VIOLATION

The DRIVER\_VERIFIER\_IOMANAGER\_VIOLATION bug check has a value of 0x000000C9. This is the bug check code for all Driver Verifier **I/O Verification** violations.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This article is for programmers. If you're a customer who has received a blue screen error code while using your computer, see [Troubleshoot blue screen errors](https://www.windows.com/stopcode).

## DRIVER\_VERIFIER\_IOMANAGER\_VIOLATION Parameters

When Driver Verifier is active and **I/O Verification** is selected, various I/O violations will cause this bug check to be issued. Parameter 1 identifies the type of violation.

In addition to the errors mentioned in the previous table, there are a number of **I/O Verification** errors that will cause Driver Verifier to halt the system, but which are not actually bug checks.

These errors cause messages to be displayed on the blue screen, in a crash dump file, and in a kernel debugger. These messages will appear differently in each of these locations. When these errors occur, the hexadecimal bug check code 0xC9 and the bug check string DRIVER\_VERIFIER\_IOMANAGER\_VIOLATION do not appear on the blue screen or in the debugger, although they will appear in a crash dump file.

On the blue screen, the following data will be displayed:

- The message **IO SYSTEM VERIFICATION ERROR**.

- The message **WDM DRIVER ERROR** *XXX*, where *XXX* is a hexadecimal code representing the specific error. (See the table below for a list of the I/O error codes and their meanings.)

- The name of the driver which caused the error.

- Typically, the address in the driver's code where the error was detected (Parameter 2).

If a kernel-mode crash dump has been enabled, the following information will appear in the crash dump file:

- The message **BugCheck 0xC9 (DRIVER\_VERIFIER\_IOMANAGER\_VIOLATION)**.

- The hexadecimal I/O error code. (See the table below for a list of the I/O error codes and their meanings.)

- Typically, the address in the driver's code where the error was detected (Parameter 2).

If a kernel debugger is attached to the system which has caused this violation, the following information will be sent to the debugger:

- The message **WDM DRIVER ERROR**, along with an assessment of the severity of the error.

- The name of the driver which caused the error.

- A descriptive string which explains the cause of this error. Often additional information is passed along, such as a pointer to the IRP or a pointer to the device object or IRQL information. (See the table below for a list of these descriptive strings and what additional information is specified.)

- A query for further action. Possible responses are **b** (break), **i** (ignore), **z** (zap), **r** (remove), or **d** (disable). Instructing the operating system to continue allows you to see what would happen "down the line" if this error had not occurred. Of course, this often will lead to additional bug checks. The "zap" option will actually remove the breakpoint that caused this error to be discovered.

**Note**   No other bug checks can be ignored in this manner. Only this kind of **I/O Verification** errors can be ignored, and even these errors can only be ignored if a kernel debugger is attached.

The following table lists those **I/O Verification** errors that can appear.

## Cause

See the description of each code in the Parameters section for a description of the cause.

## Resolution

This bug check can only occur when Driver Verifier has been instructed to monitor one or more drivers. If you did not intend to use Driver Verifier, you should deactivate it. For more information, see "How to control Driver Verifier" in [Driver Verifier](../devtest/driver-verifier.md). You might consider updating or removing the driver which caused this problem as well.

If you are the driver developer, use the information obtained through this bug check to fix the bugs in your code.

For full details on Driver Verifier, see [Driver Verifier](../devtest/driver-verifier.md).
