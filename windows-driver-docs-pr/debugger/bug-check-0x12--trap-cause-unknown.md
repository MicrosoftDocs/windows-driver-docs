## Resolution

The [**!analyze**](../debuggercmds/-analyze.md) debug extension displays information about the bug check and can be helpful in determining the root cause.

To start, examine the stack trace using the [**k, kb, kc, kd, kp, kP, kv (Display Stack Backtrace)**](../debuggercmds/k--kb--kc--kd--kp--kp--kv--display-stack-backtrace-.md) command. You can specify the processor number to examine the stacks on all processors. 

You can also set a breakpoint in the code leading up to this stop code and attempt to single step forward into the faulting code.

The [!idt](../debuggercmds/-idt.md) extension can be used to display the interrupt service routines (ISRs) for a specified interrupt dispatch table (IDT). 

Some of the techniques described in [Debugging an Interrupt Storm](debugging-an-interrupt-storm.md) can be used with the unexpected interrupts.

For general information about working with crash dumps, see [Crash dump analysis using the Windows debuggers (WinDbg)](crash-dump-files.md).

If you are not equipped to use the Windows debugger to work on this problem, you can use some basic troubleshooting techniques.

-   Check the System Log in Event Viewer for additional error messages that might help identify the device or driver that is causing this bug check.

-   If a driver is identified in the bug check message, disable the driver or check with the manufacturer for driver updates.

-   Confirm that any new hardware that is installed is compatible with the installed version of Windows. For example, you can get information about required hardware at [Windows 10 Specifications](https://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-10-specifications).

-   For additional general troubleshooting information, see [**Blue Screen Data**](blue-screen-data.md).
