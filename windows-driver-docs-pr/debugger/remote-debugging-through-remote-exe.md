# Remote Debugging Through Remote.exe


## <span id="ddk_remote_debugging_through_remote_exe_dbg"></span><span id="DDK_REMOTE_DEBUGGING_THROUGH_REMOTE_EXE_DBG"></span>


Remote debugging through remote.exe involves running the debugger on the remote computer and running the remote.exe tool on the local computer.

The remote computer and the local computer can be running any Windows operating system.

**Note**   Since remote.exe only works for console applications, it cannot be used to remotely control WinDbg.
