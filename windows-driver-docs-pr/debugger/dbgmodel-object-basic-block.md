# Basic Block Objects

## Summary

Basic Blocks are regions of code with (typically) one entry point and one exit point. The [disassembler](dbgmodel-object-disassembler.md)'s  DisassembleBlocks and DisassembleFunction methods both return collections of basic blocks. The DisassembleBlocks method does a simple analysis for basic blocks and may result in blocks with multiple entry points. DisassembleFunction will perform a complete flow analysis of the function resulting in basic blocks with a single entry and single exit.

## Object Properties

|Name|Description|
|--- |--- |
|StartAddress|The starting address of the basic block.|
|EndAddress|The ending address of the basic block. The block is defined by the half-open set [*StartAddress*, *EndAddress*).|
|Instructions|A [collection](dbgmodel-namespace-collections.md) of [instruction](dbgmodel-object-instruction.md) objects in the basic block.|
|InboundControlFlows|This property is only present on basic blocks which are the result of full flow analysis (e.g.: *DisassembleFunction*). It is a [collection](dbgmodel-namespace-collections.md) of [control flow](dbgmodel-object-control-flow.md) objects which describe what other blocks have inbound control flow links to this one.|
|OutboundControlFlows|This property is only present on basic blocks which are the result of full flow analysis (e.g.: *DisassembleFunction*). It is a [collection](dbgmodel-namespace-collections.md) of [control flow](dbgmodel-object-control-flow.md) objects which describe the outbound control flow links from this block to other blocks in the function.|
