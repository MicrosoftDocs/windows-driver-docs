If the driver responsible for the error can be identified, its name is printed on the blue screen and stored in memory at the location (PUNICODE\_STRING) **KiBugCheckDriver**.

## Cause

The Driver Verifier Special Pool option has caught the system accessing memory which was earlier freed. This usually indicates a system-driver synchronization problem.

For information about the special pool, consult the Driver Verifier section of the Windows Driver Kit.

## Remarks

This cannot be protected by a **try - except** handler -- it can only be protected by a probe.
