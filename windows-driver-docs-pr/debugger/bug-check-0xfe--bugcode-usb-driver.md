## BUGCODE\_USB\_DRIVER Parameters


The four bug check parameters are displayed on the bug check stop screen and available using !analyze. Parameter 1 identifies the type of violation.

| Parameter 1 | Parameter 2 | Parameter 3 | Parameter 4 | Cause of Error                            | 
|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------------------------------------|
| 0x1 | Reserved | Reserved | Reserved | An internal error has occurred in the USB stack. |
| 0x2 | Address of the pending IRP | Address of the IRP that was passed in| Address of the USB request block (URB) that caused the error | The USB client driver has submitted a URB that is still attached to another IRP pending in the bus driver.| 
|0x3| Reserved | Reserved| Reserved| The USB miniport driver has generated a bug check. This usually happens in response to a hardware failure.|
| 0x4 | Address of the IRP| Address of the URB| Reserved| The caller has submitted an IRP that is already pending in the USB bus driver.| 
| 0x5| Device extension pointer of the host controller| PCI vendor, product id for the controller| Pointer to endpoint data structure| A hardware failure has occurred because of a bad physical address found in a hardware data structure.| 
| 0x6 | Object address| Signature that was expected| Reserved | An internal data structure (object) is corrupted.|
| 0x7 | Pointer to usbport.sys debug log | Message string | File name | See the provided message string for detailed information.|
| 0x8 | 1 | Reserved | Reserved | Reserved |
| | 2 | Device object  | IRP | An IRP was received by the hub driver that it does not expect or has not registered for. |
| | 3 | Reserved | Reserved | Reserved
| | 4 | PDO if Parameter 3 is not NULL. Context if Parameter 3 is NULL. | Context or NULL | Fatal PDO trap
| | 5 | Reserved | Reserved | Reserved |
| | 6 | Time-out code. See the table below. | Time-out code context: port data | Fatal time-out

If Parameter 1 has a value of 8 and Parameter 2 has a value of 6, then Parameter 3 is a time-out code. Possible values for the time-out code are given in the following table.
