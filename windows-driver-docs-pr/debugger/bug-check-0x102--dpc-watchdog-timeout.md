## DPC\_WATCHDOG\_TIMEOUT Parameters


| Parameter | Description                                            |
|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| 1         | DPC watchdog time out interval in nominal clock ticks. |
| 2         | The PRCB address of the hung processor.                |
| 3         | Reserved                                               |
| 4         | Reserved                                               |

 

## Cause

This bug check typically means that either an ISR is hung at an IRQL that is below clock level and above dispatch level, or a DPC routine is hung on the specified processor.

For example for StorPort Miniport drivers, StorPort.sys handles I/O completions in a routine that runs at DISPATCH\_LEVEL and that serially calls the I/O completion routines of all IRPs that have just completed. If I/O completion routines singly or together take too much time, the keyboard and/or mouse may stop responding. It is also possible that the Windows DPC Watchdog timer routine will decide that the StorPort routine has taken excessive time to finish.

## Resolution

A kernel driver in the storage stack can reduce the problem's likelihood by efficient coding of the driver's I/O completion routine. If it is still not possible to do all necessary processing in the completion routine in enough time, the routine can create a work element for the I/O work, queue up the element to a work queue and return STATUS\_MORE\_PROCESSING\_REQUIRED; a worker thread of the driver should then find the work element, do the work and do IoCallerDriver for the IRP to ensure the IRP's further I/O processing.
