# Positioning the Windows


## <span id="ddk_positioning_the_windows_dbg"></span><span id="DDK_POSITIONING_THE_WINDOWS_DBG"></span>


Each debugging information window can be *floating* or *docked*.

You can position *floating windows* separately from other windows. *Docked windows* are connected to the WinDbg window or to an independent dock. Each docked window can occupy a unique position in its dock or can be combined with other docked windows in a *tabbed collection*.

This section includes the following topics:
