# Debugger Data Model C++ Objects

This topic describes how to use Debugger Data Model C++ Objects and how they can extend the capabilities of the debugger.

## <span id="core">  The Core Debugger Object Model

One of the most basic yet powerful things about the data model is that it standardizes the definition of what an object is and how one
interacts with an object. The *IModelObject* interface encapsulates the notion of an object -- whether that object is an integer, a floating
point value, a string, some complex type in the target address space of the debugger, or some debugger concept like the notion of a process or a
module.

There are several different things that can be held in (or boxed into) an *IModelObject*:

- **Intrinsic Values** - An *IModelObject* can be a container for a number of basic types: 8, 16, 32, or 64 bit signed or unsigned
    integers, booleans, strings, errors, or the notion of empty.

- **Native Objects** - An *IModelObject* can represent a complex type (as defined by the debugger's type system) within the address space
    of whatever the debugger is targeting 

- **Synthetic Objects** - An *IModelObject* can be a dynamic object --
    a dictionary if you will: a collection of key / value / metadata
    tuples and a set of **concepts** which define behaviors that aren't
    simply represented by key / value pairs.

- **Properties** - An *IModelObject* can represent a property:
    something whose value can be retrieved or altered with a method call. A property within an *IModelObject* is effectively an *IModelPropertyAccessor* interface boxed into an *IModelObject*

- **Methods** - An *IModelObject* can represent a method: something you can call with a set of arguments and get a return value. A
    method within an *IModelObject* is effectively an *IModelMethod* interface boxed into an *IModelObject*

### Extensibility Within The Object Model

An *IModelObject* is not an object in isolation. In addition to representing one of the types of objects shown above, each object has
the notion of a chain of parent data models. This chain behaves much like a [JavaScript prototype
chain](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Inheritance_and_the_prototype_chain).
Instead of a linear chain of prototypes like JavaScript has, each data model object defines a linear chain of **parent models**. Each of those
parent models in turn has another linear chain of its own set of parents. In essence, each object is an aggregation of the capabilities
(properties, etc...) of both itself and every object in this tree. When a specific property is queried, if the object it is queried on does not
support that property, the query is passed in linear order to each parent in turn. This creates a behavior where the search for a property
is resolved by a depth-first search of the aggregate tree.

Extensibility within this object model is very simple given this notion that every object is an aggregate of itself and the tree of parent
models. An extension can come in and add itself into the list of parent models for another object. Doing this **extends** the object. In this
manner, it is possible to add capabilities onto anything: a particular instance of an object or value, a native type, the debugger's concept of
what a process or thread is, or even the notion of "all iterable objects".

### Context, Context, and Context: The **this** Pointer, The Address Space, and Implementation Private Data

There are three notions of **context** which are necessary to understand
within the context of the object model.

#### Context: The **this** Pointer

Since a given property or method may be implemented at any level of the
data model tree, it is necessary for the implementation of the method or
property to be able to access the original object (what you might call
the **this** pointer in C++ or the **this** object in JavaScript. That
instance object is passed to a variety of methods as the first argument
called **context** in the methods described.

#### Context: The Address Space

It is important to note that unlike prior extension models where
**context** (the target, process, thread you are looking at) is a UI
concept with all APIs relative to the current UI state, data model
interfaces typically take this context either explicitly or implicitly
as an *IDebugHostContext* interface. Each *IModelObject* within the data
model carries this type of context information along with it and can
propagate that context to objects it returns. This means that when you
read a native value or a key value out of an *IModelObject*, it will
read out of the target and process where the object was originally
acquired from.

There is an explicit constant value, **USE\_CURRENT\_HOST\_CONTEXT**,
that can be passed to methods which take an *IDebugHostContext*
argument. This value indicates that the context should indeed be the
current UI state of the debugger. This notion does, however, need to be
explicit.

#### Context: Implementation Private Data

Remember that each object in the data model is actually an aggregate of
the object instance and the tree of parent models which are attached.
Each of those parent models (which can be linked in the chains of many
different objects) can associate private implementation data with any
instance object. Each *IModelObject* which is created conceptually has a
hash table that maps from a particular parent model to private instance
data defined by an *IUnknown* interface. This allows a parent model to
cache information on every instance or have otherwise arbitrary data
associated.

This type of context is accessed through the *GetContextForDataModel*
and *SetContextForDataModel* methods on *IModelObject*.

    STDMETHOD(IsEqualTo)(_In_ IModelObject* other, _Out_ bool* equal) PURE;
}
```

**Basic Methods**

The following are general methods applicable to any kind of object represented by an IModelObject. 

```cpp
STDMETHOD(GetKind)(_Out_ ModelObjectKind *kind) PURE;
STDMETHOD(GetContext)(_COM_Outptr_result_maybenull_ IDebugHostContext** context) PURE;
STDMETHOD(GetIntrinsicValue)(_Out_ VARIANT* intrinsicData);
STDMETHOD(GetIntrinsicValueAs)(_In_ VARTYPE vt, _Out_ VARIANT* intrinsicData) PURE;
STDMETHOD(Compare)(_In_ IModelObject* other, _COM_Outptr_opt_result_maybenull_ IModelObject **ppResult) PURE;
STDMETHOD(IsEqualTo)(_In_ IModelObject* other, _Out_ bool* equal) PURE;
STDMETHOD(Dereference)(_COM_Errorptr_ IModelObject** object) PURE;
```

[GetKind](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/dbgmodel/nf-dbgmodel-imodelobject-getkind) 

The GetKind method returns what kind of object is boxed inside the IModelObject. 

[GetContext](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/dbgmodel/nf-dbgmodel-imodelobject-getcontext)

The GetContext method returns the host context that is associated with the object. 

[GetIntrinsicValue](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/dbgmodel/nf-dbgmodel-imodelobject-getintrinsicvalue)

The GetIntrinsicValue method returns the thing which is boxed inside an IModelObject. This method may only legally be called on IModelObject interfaces which represent a boxed intrinsic or a particular interface which is boxed. It cannot be called on native objects, no value objects, synthetic objects, and reference objects. The GetIntrinsicValueAs method behaves much as the GetIntrinsicValue method excepting that it converts the value to the specified variant type. If the conversion cannot be performed, the method returns an error.

[IsEqualTo](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/dbgmodel/nf-dbgmodel-imodelobject-isequalto)

The IsEqualTo method compares two model objects and returns whether they are equal in value. For object which have an ordering, this method returning true is equivalent to the Compare method returning 0. For objects that have no ordering but are equatable, the Compare method will fail, but this will not. The meaning of a value based comparison is defined by the type of object. At present, this is only defined for intrinsic types and error objects. There is no current data model concept for equability. 

[Dereference](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/dbgmodel/nf-dbgmodel-imodelobject-dereference)

The Dereference method dereferences an object. This method can be used to dereference a data model based reference (ObjectTargetObjectReference, ObjectKeyReference) or a native language reference (a pointer or a language reference). It is important to note that this method removes a single level of reference semantics on the object. It is entirely possible to, for instance, have a data model reference to a language reference. In such a case, calling the Dereference method the first time would remove the data model reference and leave the language reference. Calling Dereference on that resulting object would subsequently remove the language reference and return the native value under that reference. 


**Key Manipulation Methods**

Any synthetic object which is a dictionary of key, value, and metadata tuples has a series of methods to manipulate those keys, values, and the metadata associated with them. 

The value based forms of the APIs are: 

```cpp
STDMETHOD(GetKeyValue)(_In_ PCWSTR key, _COM_Errorptr_opt_ IModelObject** object, _COM_Outptr_opt_result_maybenull_ IKeyStore** metadata) PURE;
STDMETHOD(SetKeyValue)(_In_ PCWSTR key, _In_opt_ IModelObject* object) PURE;
STDMETHOD(EnumerateKeyValues)(_COM_Outptr_ IKeyEnumerator** enumerator) PURE;
The key based forms of the APIs (including those used for key creation) are: 
STDMETHOD(GetKey)(_In_ PCWSTR key, _COM_Errorptr_opt_ IModelObject** object, _COM_Outptr_opt_result_maybenull_ IKeyStore** metadata) PURE;
STDMETHOD(SetKey)(_In_ PCWSTR key, _In_opt_ IModelObject* object, _In_opt_ IKeyStore* metadata) PURE;
STDMETHOD(EnumerateKeys)(_COM_Outptr_ IKeyEnumerator** enumerator) PURE;
STDMETHOD(ClearKeys)() PURE;
```

The reference based forms of the APIs are: 

```cpp
STDMETHOD(GetKeyReference)(_In_ PCWSTR key, _COM_Errorptr_opt_ IModelObject** objectReference, _COM_Outptr_opt_result_maybenull_ IKeyStore** metadata) PURE;
STDMETHOD(EnumerateKeyReferences)(_COM_Outptr_ IKeyEnumerator** enumerator) PURE;
```

[GetKeyValue](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/dbgmodel/nf-dbgmodel-imodelobject-getkeyvalue)

The GetKeyValue method is the first method a client will turn to in order to get the value of (and the metadata associated with) a given key by name. If the key is a property accessor -- that is it's value as an IModelObject which is a boxed IModelPropertyAccessor, the GetKeyValue method will automatically call the property accessor's GetValue method in order to retrieve the actual value.

[SetKeyValue](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/dbgmodel/nf-dbgmodel-imodelobject-setkeyvalue)

The SetKeyValue method is the first method a client will turn to in order to set the value of a key. This method cannot be used to create a new key on an object. It will only set the value of an existing key. Note that many keys are read-only (e.g.: they are implemented by a property accessor which returns E_NOT_IMPL from it's SetValue method). This method will fail when called on a read only key. 

[EnumerateKeyValues](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/dbgmodel/nf-dbgmodel-imodelobject-enumeratekeyvalues)

The EnumerateKeyValues method is the first method a client will turn to in order to enumerate all of the keys on an object (this includes all keys implemented anywhere in the tree of parent models). It is important to note that EnumerateKeyValues will enumerate any keys defined by duplicate names in the object tree; however -- methods like GetKeyValue and SetKeyValue will only manipulate the first instance of a key with the given name as discovered by the depth-first-traversal. 

[GetKey](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/dbgmodel/nf-dbgmodel-imodelobject-getkey)

The GetKey method will get the value of (and the metadata associated with) a given key by name. Most clients should utilize the GetKeyValue method instead. If the key is a property accessor, calling this method will return the property accessor (an IModelPropertyAccessor interface) boxed into an IModelObject. Unlike, GetKeyValue, this method will not automatically resolve the underlying value of the key by calling the GetValue method. That responsibility is the caller's. 

[SetKey](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/dbgmodel/nf-dbgmodel-imodelobject-setkey)

The SetKey method is the method a client will turn to in order to create a key on an object (and potentially associate metadata with the created key). If a given object already has a key with the given name, one of two behaviors will occur. If the key is on the instance given by this, the value of that key will be replaced as if the original key did not exist. If, on the other hand, the key is in the chain of parent data models of the instance given by this, a new key with the given name will be created on the instance given by this. This would, in effect, cause the object to have two keys of the same name (similar to a derived class shadowing a member of the same name as a base class). 

[EnumerateKeys](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/dbgmodel/nf-dbgmodel-imodelobject-enumeratekeys)

The EnumerateKeys method behaves similar to the EnumerateKeyValues method excepting that it does not automatically resolve property accessors on the object. This means that if the value of a key is a property accessor, the EnumerateKeys method will return the property accessor (an IModelPropertyAccessorInterface) boxed into an IModelObject rather than automatically calling the GetValue method. This is similar to the difference between GetKey and GetKeyValue. 

[ClearKeys](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/dbgmodel/nf-dbgmodel-imodelobject-clearkeys)

The ClearKeys method removes all keys and their associated values and metadata from the instance of the object specified by this. This method has no effect on parent models attached to the particular object instance. 

[GetKeyReference](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/dbgmodel/nf-dbgmodel-imodelobject-getkeyreference)

The GetKeyReference method will search for a key of the given name on the object (or its parent model chain) and return a reference to that key given by an IModelKeyReference interface boxed into an IModelObject. That reference can subsequently be used to get or set the value of the key. 

[EnumerateKeyReferences](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/dbgmodel/nf-dbgmodel-imodelobject-enumeratekeyreferences)

The EnumerateKeyReferences method behaves similar to the EnumerateKeyValues method excepting that it returns references to the keys it enumerates (given by an IModelKeyReference interface boxed into an IModelObject) instead of the value of the key. Such references can be used to get or set the underlying value of the keys.

**Concept Manipulation Methods**

In addition to a model object being a dictionary of key/value/metadata tuples, it is also a container of concepts. A concept is something abstract that can be performed on or by an object. Concepts are, in essence, a dynamic store of interfaces that an object supports. A number of concepts are defined by the data model today: 

Concept Interface | Description
------------------|-------------
IDataModelConcept | The concept is a parent model. If this model is automatically attached to a native type via a registered type signature, the InitializeObject method will automatically be called every time a new object of such type is instantiated.
IStringDisplayableConcept  | The object can be converted to a string for display purposes.
IIterableConcept  | The object is a container and can be iterated.
IIndexableConcept  | The object is a container and can be indexed (accessed via random access) in one or more dimensions.
IPreferredRuntimeTypeConcept  | The object understands more about types derived from it than the underlying type system is capable of providing and would like to handle its own conversions from static to runtime type.
IDynamicKeyProviderConcept | The object is a dynamic provider of keys and wishes to take over all key queries from the core data model. This interface is typically used as a bridge to dynamic languages such as JavaScript.
IDynamicConceptProviderConcept  | The object is a dynamic provider of concepts and wishes to take over all concept queries from the core data model. This interface is typically used as a bridge to dynamic languages such as JavaScript.

The following methods on IModelObject are utilized to manipulate the concepts that an object supports. 

```cpp
STDMETHOD(GetConcept)(_In_ REFIID conceptId, _COM_Outptr_ IUnknown** conceptInterface, _COM_Outptr_opt_result_maybenull_ IKeyStore** conceptMetadata) PURE;
STDMETHOD(SetConcept)(_In_ REFIID conceptId, _In_ IUnknown* conceptInterface, _In_opt_ IKeyStore* conceptMetadata) PURE;
STDMETHOD(ClearConcepts)() PURE;
```

[GetConcept](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/dbgmodel/nf-dbgmodel-imodelobject-getconcept)

The GetConcept method will search for a concept on the object (or its parent model chain) and return an interface pointer to the concept interface. The behavior and methods on a concept interface are specific to each concept. It is important to note, however, that many of the concept interfaces require the caller to explicitly pass the context object (or what one might traditionally call the this pointer). It is important to ensure that the correct context object is passed to every concept interface.

[SetConcept](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/dbgmodel/nf-dbgmodel-imodelobject-setconcept)

The SetConcept method will place a specified concept on the object instance specified by the this pointer. If a parent model attached to the object instance specified by this also supports the concept, the implementation in the instance will override that in the parent model. 

[ClearConcepts](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/dbgmodel/nf-dbgmodel-imodelobject-clearconcepts)

The ClearConcepts method will remove all concepts from the instance of the object specified by this. 

**Native Object Methods**

While many model objects refer to intrinsics (e.g.: integers, strings) or synthetic constructs (a dictionary of key/value/metadata tuples and concepts), a model object may also refer to a native construct (e.g.: a user defined type in the address space of the debug target). The IModelObject interface has a series of methods on it which access information about such native objects. Those methods are: 

```cpp
STDMETHOD(GetRawValue)(_In_ SymbolKind kind, _In_ PCWSTR name, _In_ ULONG searchFlags, _COM_Errorptr_ IModelObject** object) PURE;
STDMETHOD(EnumerateRawValues)(_In_ SymbolKind kind, _In_ ULONG searchFlags, _COM_Outptr_ IRawEnumerator** enumerator) PURE;
STDMETHOD(TryCastToRuntimeType)(_COM_Errorptr_ IModelObject** runtimeTypedObject) PURE;
STDMETHOD(GetLocation)(_Out_ Location* location) PURE;
STDMETHOD(GetTypeInfo)(_Out_ IDebugHostType** type) PURE;
STDMETHOD(GetTargetInfo)(_Out_ Location* location, _Out_ IDebugHostType** type) PURE;
STDMETHOD(GetRawReference)(_In_ SymbolKind kind, _In_ PCWSTR name, _In_ ULONG searchFlags, _COM_Errorptr_ IModelObject** object) PURE;
STDMETHOD(EnumerateRawReferences)(_In_ SymbolKind kind, _In_ ULONG searchFlags, _COM_Outptr_ IRawEnumerator** enumerator) PURE;
```

[GetRawValue](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/dbgmodel/nf-dbgmodel-imodelobject-getrawvalue)

The GetRawValue method finds a native construct within the given object. Such a construct may be a field, a base class, a field in a base class, a member function, etc...

[EnumerateRawValues](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/dbgmodel/nf-dbgmodel-imodelobject-enumeraterawvalues)

The EnumerateRawValues method enumerates all native children (e.g.: fields, base classes, etc...) of the given object. 


[TryCastToRuntimeType](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/dbgmodel/nf-dbgmodel-imodelobject-trycasttoruntimetype)

The TryCastToRuntimeType method will ask the debug host to perform an analysis and determine the actual runtime type (e.g.: most derived class) of the given object. The exact analysis utilized is specific to the debug host and may include RTTI (C++ run time type information), examination of the V-Table(virtual function table) structure of the object, or any other means that the host can use to reliably determine dynamic/runtime type from the static type. Failure to convert to a runtime type does not mean that this method call will fail. In such cases, the method will return the given object (the this pointer) in the output argument. 

[GetLocation](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/dbgmodel/nf-dbgmodel-imodelobject-getlocation) 

The GetLocation method will return the location of the native object. While such a location is typically a virtual address within the address space of the debug target, it is not necessarily so. The location returned by this method is an abstract location that may be a virtual address, may indicate placement within a register or sub-register, or may indicate some other arbitrary address space as defined by the debug host. If the HostDefined field of the resulting Location object is 0, it indicates that the location is actually a virtual address. Such virtual address may be retrieved by examining the Offset field of the resulting location. Any non-zero value of the HostDefined field indicates an alternate address space where the Offset field is the offset within that address space. The exact meaning of non-zero HostDefined values here are private to the debug host. 

[GetTypeInfo](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/dbgmodel/nf-dbgmodel-imodelobject-gettypeinfo)

The GetTypeInfo method will return the native type of the given object. If the object does not have native type information associated with it (e.g.: it is an intrinsic, etc...), the call will still succeed but will return null. 

[GetTargetInfo](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/dbgmodel/nf-dbgmodel-imodelobject-gettargetinfo)

The GetTargetInfo method is effectively a combination of the GetLocation and GetTypeInfo methods returning both the abstract location as well as native type of the given object. 

[GetRawReference](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/dbgmodel/nf-dbgmodel-imodelobject-getrawreference)

The GetRawReference method finds a native construct within the given object and returns a reference to it. Such a construct may be a field, a base class, a field in a base class, a member function, etc... It is important to distinguish the reference returned here (an object of the type ObjectTargetObjectReference) from a language reference (e.g.: a C++ & or && style reference). 

[EnumerateRawReferences](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/dbgmodel/nf-dbgmodel-imodelobject-enumeraterawreferences)

The EnumerateRawReferences method enumerates references to all native children (e.g.: fields, base classes, etc...) of the given object. 


**Extensibility Methods**

As described earlier, a model object behaves very similar to a JavaScript object and its prototype chain. In addition to the instance represented by a given IModelObject interface, there may be an arbitrary number of parent models attached to the object (each of which may, in turn, have an arbitrary number of parent models attached to them). This is the primary means for extensibility within the data model. If a given property or concept cannot be located within a given instance, a depth-first search of the object tree (defined by parent models) rooted at the instance is performed.

The following methods manipulate the chain of parent models associated with a given IModelObject instance: 

```cpp
STDMETHOD(GetNumberOfParentModels)(_Out_ ULONG64* numModels) PURE;
STDMETHOD(GetParentModel)(_In_ ULONG64 i, _COM_Outptr_ IModelObject **model, _COM_Outptr_result_maybenull_ IModelObject **contextObject) PURE;
STDMETHOD(AddParentModel)(_In_ IModelObject* model, _In_opt_ IModelObject* contextObject, _In_ bool override) PURE;
STDMETHOD(RemoveParentModel)(_In_ IModelObject* model) PURE;
STDMETHOD(SetContextForDataModel)(_In_ IModelObject* dataModelObject, _In_ IUnknown* context) PURE;
STDMETHOD(GetContextForDataModel)(_In_ IModelObject* dataModelObject, _Out_ IUnknown** context) PURE;
```

[GetNumberOfParentModels](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/dbgmodel/nf-dbgmodel-imodelobject-getnumberofparentmodels)

The GetNumberOfParentModels method returns the number of parent models which are attached to the given object instance. Parent models are searched for properties depth-first in the linear ordering of the parent model chain. 

[GetParentModel](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/dbgmodel/nf-dbgmodel-imodelobject-getparentmodel)

The GetParentModel method returns the i-th parent model in the parent model chain of the given object. Parent models are searched for a property or concept in the linear order they are added or enumerated. The parent model with index i of zero is searched (hierarchically) before the parent model with index i + 1. 

[AddParentModel](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/dbgmodel/nf-dbgmodel-imodelobject-addparentmodel)

The AddParentModel method adds a new parent model to the given object. Such a model may be added at the end of the search chain (the override argument is specified as false) or at the front of the search chain (the override argument is specified as true). In addition, each parent model may optionally adjust the context (the semantic this pointer) for any property or concept on the given parent (or anyone in its parent hierarchy). Context adjustment is seldom used but allows for some powerful concepts like object embedding, constructing namespaces, etc... 

[RemoveParentModel](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/dbgmodel/nf-dbgmodel-imodelobject-removeparentmodel)

The RemoveParentModel will remove a specified parent model from the parent search chain of the given object. 

[SetContextForDataModel](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/dbgmodel/nf-dbgmodel-imodelobject-setcontextfordatamodel)

The SetContextForDataModel method is used by the implementation of a data model to place implementation data on instance objects. Conceptually, each IModelObject (call this the instance for simplicity) contains a hash table of state. The hash table is indexed by another IModelObject (call this the data model for simplicity) which is in the parent model hierarchy of the instance. The value contained in this hash is a set of reference counted state information represented by an IUnknown instance. Once the data model sets this state on the instance it can store arbitrary implementation data which can be retrieved during things like property getters. 

[GetContextForDataModel](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/dbgmodel/nf-dbgmodel-imodelobject-getcontextfordatamodel)

The GetContextForDataModel method is used to retrieve context information which was set up with a prior call to SetContextForDataModel. This retrieves state information which was set on an instance object by a data model further up in the instance object's parent model hierarchy.

An object in the data model is similar to the notion of Object in .NET. It is the generic container into which construct that the data model understands can be boxed. In addition to native objects and synthetic (dynamic) objects, there are a series of core object types which can be placed (or boxed) into the container of an IModelObject. The container in which most of these values are placed is a standard COM/OLE VARIANT with a number of additional restrictions placed upon what that VARIANT can contain. The most basic types of these are:

- 8-bit unsigned and signed values (VT_UI1, VT_I1)
- 16-bit unsigned and signed values (VT_UI2, VT_UI2)
- 32-bit unsigned and signed values (VT_UI4, VT_I4)
- 64-bit unsigned and signed values (VT_UI8, VT_I8)
- Single and double precision floating point values (VT_R4, VT_R8)
- Strings (VT_BSTR)
- Booleans (VT_BOOL)

In addition to these basic types, a number of core data model objects are placed into IModelObject defined by VT_UNKNOWN where the stored IUnknown is guaranteed to implement a specific interface. These types are: 

- Property accessors (IModelPropertyAccessor)
- Method objects (IModelMethod)
- Key reference objects (IModelKeyReference or IModelKeyReference2)
- Context objects (IDebugModelHostContext)

**Property Accessors:  *IModelPropertyAccessor***

A property accessor in the data model is an implementation of the IModelPropertyAccessor interface which is boxed into an IModelObject. The model object will return a kind of ObjectPropertyAccessor when queried and the intrinsic value is a VT_UNKNOWN which is guaranteed to be queryable for IModelPropertyAccessor. In process, it is guaranteed to be statically castable to IModelPropertyAccessor. 

A property accessor is an indirect way to get a method call for getting and setting a key value in the data model. If a given key's value is a property accessor, the GetKeyValue and SetKeyValue methods will automatically notice this and call the property accessor's underlying GetValue or SetValue methods as appropriate. 

The IModelPropertyAccessor interface is defined as follows: 

```cpp
DECLARE_INTERFACE_(IModelPropertyAccessor, IUnknown)
{
    STDMETHOD(GetValue)(_In_ PCWSTR key, _In_opt_ IModelObject* contextObject, _COM_Outptr_ IModelObject** value) PURE;
    STDMETHOD(SetValue)(_In_ PCWSTR key, _In_opt_ IModelObject* contextObject, _In_ IModelObject* value) PURE; 
}
```

[GetValue](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/dbgmodel/nf-dbgmodel-imodelpropertyaccessor-getvalue)

The GetValue method is the getter for the property accessor. It is called whenever a client wishes to fetch the underlying value of the property. Note that any caller which directly gets a property accessor is responsible for passing the key name and accurate instance object (this pointer) to the property accessor's GetValue method. 

[SetValue](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/dbgmodel/nf-dbgmodel-imodelpropertyaccessor-setvalue)

The SetValue method is the setter for the property accessor. It is called whenever a client wishes to assign a value to the underlying property. Many properties are read-only. In such cases, calling the SetValue method will return E_NOTIMPL. Note that any caller which directly gets a property accessor is responsible for passing the key name and accurate instance object (this pointer) to the property accessor's SetValue method. 

**Methods: *IModelMethod***

A method in the data model is an implementation of the IModelMethod interface which is boxed into an IModelObject. The model object will return a kind of ObjectMethod when queried and the intrinsic value is a VT_UNKNOWN which is guaranteed to be queryable for IModelMethod. In process, it is guaranteed to be statically castable to IModelMethod. 
All methods in the data model are dynamic in nature. They take as input a set of 0 or more arguments and return a single output value. There is no overload resolution and no metadata about parameter names, types, or expectations. 

The IModelMethod interface is defined as follows: 

```cpp
DECLARE_INTERFACE_(IModelMethod, IUnknown)
{
    STDMETHOD(Call)(_In_opt_ IModelObject *pContextObject, _In_ ULONG64 argCount, _In_reads_(argCount) IModelObject **ppArguments, _COM_Errorptr_ IModelObject **ppResult, _COM_Outptr_opt_result_maybenull_ IKeyStore **ppMetadata) PURE;
}
```

[Call](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/dbgmodel/nf-dbgmodel-imodelmethod-call)

The Call method is the way in which any method defined in the data model is invoked. The caller is responsible for passing an accurate instance object (this pointer) and an arbitrary set of arguments. The result of the method and any optional metadata associated with that result is returned. Methods which do not logically return a value still must return a valid IModelObject. In such a case, the IModelObject is a boxed no value. In the event a method fails, it may return optional extended error information in the input argument (even if the returned HRESULT is a failure). It is imperative that callers check for this. 

**Key References: *IModelKeyReference or IModelKeyReference2***

A key reference is, in essence, a handle to a key on a particular object. A client can retrieve such handle via methods such as GetKeyReference and use the handle later to get or set the value of the key without necessarily holding onto the original object. This type of object is an implementation of the IModelKeyReference or IModelKeyReference2 interface which is boxed into an IModelObject. The model object will return a kind of ObjectKeyReference when queried and then intrinsic value is a VT_UNKNOWN which is guaranteed to be queryable for IModelKeyReference. In process, it is guaranteed to be statically castable to IModelKeyReference. 

The key reference interface is defined as follows: 

```cpp
DECLARE_INTERFACE_(IModelKeyReference2, IModelKeyReference)
{
    STDMETHOD(GetKeyName)(_Out_ BSTR* keyName) PURE;
    STDMETHOD(GetOriginalObject)(_COM_Outptr_ IModelObject** originalObject) PURE;
    STDMETHOD(GetContextObject)(_COM_Outptr_ IModelObject** containingObject) PURE;
    STDMETHOD(GetKey)(_COM_Errorptr_opt_ IModelObject** object, _COM_Outptr_opt_result_maybenull_ IKeyStore** metadata) PURE;
    STDMETHOD(GetKeyValue)(_COM_Errorptr_opt_ IModelObject** object, _COM_Outptr_opt_result_maybenull_ IKeyStore** metadata) PURE;
    STDMETHOD(SetKey)(_In_opt_ IModelObject* object, _In_opt_ IKeyStore* metadata) PURE;
    STDMETHOD(SetKeyValue)(_In_ IModelObject* object) PURE;
    STDMETHOD(OverrideContextObject)(_In_ IModelObject* newContextObject) PURE;
}
```

[GetKeyName](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/dbgmodel/nf-dbgmodel-imodelkeyreference-getkeyname)

The GetKeyName method returns the name of the key to which this key reference is a handle. The returned string is a standard BSTR and must be freed via a call to SysFreeString. 

[GetOriginalObject](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/dbgmodel/nf-dbgmodel-imodelkeyreference-getoriginalobject)

The GetOriginalObject method returns the instance object from which the key reference was created. Note that the key may itself be on a parent model of the instance object. 

[GetContextObject](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/dbgmodel/nf-dbgmodel-imodelkeyreference-getcontextobject)

The GetContextObject method returns the context (this pointer) which will be passed to a property accessor's GetValue or SetValue method if the key in question refers to a property accessor. The context object returned here may or may not be the same as the original object fetched from GetOriginalObject. If a key is on a parent model and there is a context adjustor associated with that parent model, the original object is the instance object on which GetKeyReference or EnumerateKeyReferences was called. The context object would be whatever comes out of the final context adjustor between the original object and the parent model containing the key to which this key reference is a handle. If there are no context adjustors, the original object and the context object are identical. 

[GetKey](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/dbgmodel/nf-dbgmodel-imodelkeyreference-getkey)

The GetKey method on a key reference behaves as the GetKey method on IModelObject would. It returns the value of the underlying key and any metadata associated with the key. If the value of the key happens to be a property accessor, this will return the property accessor (IModelPropertyAccessor) boxed into an IModelObject. This method will not call the underlying GetValue or SetValue methods on the property accessor. 

[GetKeyValue](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/dbgmodel/nf-dbgmodel-imodelkeyreference-getkeyvalue)

The GetKeyValue method on a key reference behaves as the GetKeyValue method on IModelObject would. It returns the value of the underlying key and any metadata associated with the key. If the value of the key happens to be a property accessor, this will call the underlying GetValue method on the property accessor automatically. 

[SetKey](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/dbgmodel/nf-dbgmodel-imodelkeyreference-setkey)

The SetKey method on a key reference behaves as the SetKey method on IModelObject would. It will assign the value of the key. If the original key was a property accessor, this will replace the property accessor. It will not call the SetValue method on the property accessor. 


[SetKeyValue](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/dbgmodel/nf-dbgmodel-imodelkeyreference-setkeyvalue)

The SetKeyValue method on a key reference behaves as the SetKeyValue method on IModelObject would. It will assign the value of the key. If the original key was a property accessor, this will call the underlying SetValue method on the property accessor rather than replacing the property accessor itself.

[OverrideContextObject](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/dbgmodel/nf-dbgmodel-imodelkeyreference2-overridecontextobject)

The OverrideContextObject method (only present on IModelKeyReference2) is an advanced method which is used to permanently alter the context object which this key reference will pass to any underlying property accessor's GetValue or SetValue methods. The object passed to this method will also be returned from a call to GetContextObject. This method can be used by script providers to replicate certain dynamic language behaviors. Most clients should not call this method. 


**Context Objects: *IDebugHostContext***

Context objects are opaque blobs of information that the debug host (in cooperation with the data model) associates with every object. It may include things such as the process context or address space the information comes from, etc... A context object is an implementation of IDebugHostContext boxed within an IModelObject. Note that IDebugHostContext is a host defined interface. A client will never implement this interface. 

For more information about context objects, see [Debugger Data Model C++ Host Interfaces](data-model-cpp-interfaces.md#hostinterface) in Debugger Data Model C++ Interfaces. 

## <span id="modelmanager"> The Data Model Manager  

The core interface to the data model manager, IDataModelManager2 (or the earlier IDataModelManager) is defined as follows: 

```cpp
DECLARE_INTERFACE_(IDataModelManager2, IDataModelManager)
{
    //
    // IDataModelManager:
    //
    STDMETHOD(Close)() PURE;
    STDMETHOD(CreateNoValue)(_Out_ IModelObject** object) PURE;

    STDMETHOD(CreateMetadataStore)(_In_opt_ IKeyStore* parentStore, _COM_Outptr_ IKeyStore** metadataStore) PURE;
    STDMETHOD(GetRootNamespace)(_COM_Outptr_ IModelObject** rootNamespace) PURE;

    STDMETHOD(AcquireSubNamespace)(_In_ PCWSTR modelName, _In_ PCWSTR subNamespaceModelName, _In_ PCWSTR accessName, _In_opt_ IKeyStore *metadata, _COM_Outptr_ IModelObject **namespaceModelObject) PURE;
    STDMETHOD(CreateTypedIntrinsicObjectEx)(_In_opt_ IDebugHostContext* context, _In_ VARIANT* intrinsicData, _In_ IDebugHostType* type, _COM_Outptr_ IModelObject** object) PURE;
}
```

**Management Methods**

The following set of methods is utilized by the application (e.g.: debugger) hosting the data model. 

```cpp
STDMETHOD(Close)() PURE;
```

[Close](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/dbgmodel/nf-dbgmodel-idatamodelmanager-close)

The Close method is called on the data model manager by an application (e.g.: debugger) hosting the data model in order to start the shutdown process of the data model manager. A host of the data model which does not the Close method prior to releasing its final reference on the data model manager may cause undefined behavior including, but not limited to, significant leaks of the management infrastructure for the data model. 

**Object Creation / Boxing Methods**

The following set of methods is used to create new objects or to box values into an IModelObject -- the core interface of the data model. 

```cpp
STDMETHOD(CreateNoValue)(_Out_ IModelObject** object) PURE;
STDMETHOD(CreateErrorObject)(_In_ HRESULT hrError, _In_opt_ PCWSTR pwszMessage, _COM_Outptr_ IModelObject** object) PURE;
STDMETHOD(CreateTypedObject)(_In_opt_ IDebugHostContext* context, _In_ Location objectLocation, _In_ IDebugHostType* objectType, _COM_Errorptr_ IModelObject** object) PURE;
STDMETHOD(CreateTypedObjectReference)(_In_opt_ IDebugHostContext* context, _In_ Location objectLocation, _In_ IDebugHostType* objectType, _COM_Errorptr_ IModelObject** object) PURE;
STDMETHOD(CreateSyntheticObject)(_In_opt_ IDebugHostContext* context, _COM_Outptr_ IModelObject** object) PURE;
STDMETHOD(CreateDataModelObject)(_In_ IDataModelConcept* dataModel, _COM_Outptr_ IModelObject** object) PURE;
STDMETHOD(CreateIntrinsicObject)(_In_ ModelObjectKind objectKind, _In_ VARIANT* intrinsicData, _COM_Outptr_ IModelObject** object) PURE;
STDMETHOD(CreateTypedIntrinsicObject)(_In_ VARIANT* intrinsicData, _In_ IDebugHostType* type, _COM_Outptr_ IModelObject** object) PURE;
STDMETHOD(CreateMetadataStore)(_In_opt_ IKeyStore* parentStore, _COM_Outptr_ IKeyStore** metadataStore) PURE;
STDMETHOD(CreateTypedIntrinsicObjectEx)(_In_opt_ IDebugHostContext* context, _In_ VARIANT* intrinsicData, _In_ IDebugHostType* type, _COM_Outptr_ IModelObject** object) PURE;
```

[CreateNoValue](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/dbgmodel/nf-dbgmodel-idatamodelmanager-createnovalue)

The CreateNoValue method creates a "no value" object, boxes it into an IModelObject, and returns it. The returned model object has a kind of ObjectNoValue. 

A "no value" object has several semantic meanings: 

- (Depending on language), it can be considered the semantic equivalent of void, null, or undefined
- Any property accessor's GetValue method which returns success and a resulting "no value" object is indicating that the particular property has no value for the given instance and should be treated as if the property did not exist for that particular instance.
- Data model methods which do not semantically have a return value use this as a sentinel to indicate such (as a method must return a valid IModelObject).

[CreateErrorObject](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/dbgmodel/nf-dbgmodel-idatamodelmanager-createerrorobject)

The CreateErrorObject method creates an "error object". The data model does not have the notion of exceptions and exception flow. Failure comes out of a property/method in two ways:

- A single failing HRESULT with no extended error information. Either there is no more information which can be given for the error or the error itself is self-explanatory from the returned HRESULT.
- A single failing HRESULT coupled with extended error information. The extended error information is an error object returned in the output argument of the property/method.

[CreateTypedObject](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/dbgmodel/nf-dbgmodel-idatamodelmanager-createtypedobject)

The CreateTypedObject method is the method which allows a client to create a representation of a native/language object in the address space of a debug target. If the type of the newly created object (as indicated by the objectType argument) happens to match one or more type signatures registered with the data model manager as either canonical visualizers or extensions, those matching data models will automatically be attached to the created instance object before it is returned to the caller. 

[CreateTypedObjectReference](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/dbgmodel/nf-dbgmodel-idatamodelmanager-createtypedobjectreference)

The CreateTypedObjectReference method is semantically similar to the CreateTypedObject method excepting that it creates a reference to the underlying native/language construct. The created reference is an object which has a kind of ObjectTargetObjectReference. It is not a native reference as the underlying language might support (e.g.: a C++ & or &&). It is entirely possible to have a ObjectTargetObjectReference to a C++ reference. 
An object of kind ObjectTargetObjectReference can be converted to the underlying value through use of the Dereference method on IModelObject. The reference can also be passed to the underlying host's expression evaluator in order to assign back to the value in a language appropriate way. 

[CreateSyntheticObject](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/dbgmodel/nf-dbgmodel-idatamodelmanager-createsyntheticobject)

The CreateSyntheticObject method creates an empty data model object -- a dictionary of key/value/metadata tuples and concepts. At the time of creation, there are no keys nor concepts on the object. It is a clean slate for the caller to utilize. 

[CreateDataModelObject](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/dbgmodel/nf-dbgmodel-idatamodelmanager-createdatamodelobject)

The CreateDataModelObject method is a simple helper wrapper to create objects which are data models -- that is objects which are going to be attached as parent models to other objects. All such objects must support the data model concept via IDataModelConcept. This method creates a new blank synthetic object with no explicit context and adds the inpassed IDataModelConcept as the newly created object's implementation of the data model concept. This can similarly be accomplished with calls to CreateSyntheticObject and SetConcept. 

[CreateIntrinsicObject](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/dbgmodel/nf-dbgmodel-idatamodelmanager-createintrinsicobject)

The CreateIntrinsicObject method is the method which boxes intrinsic values into IModelObject. The caller places the value in a COM VARIANT and calls this method. The data model manager returns an IModelObject representing the object. Note that this method is also used to box fundamental IUnknown based types: property accessors, methods, contexts, etc... In such cases, the objectKind method indicates what kind of IUnknown based construct the object represents and the punkVal field of the passed variant is the IUnknown derived type. The type must be statically castable to the appropriate model interface (e.g.: IModelPropertyAccessor, IModelMethod, IDebugHostContext, etc...) in process. 
The VARIANT types that are supported by this method are VT_UI1, VT_I1, VT_UI2, VT_I2, VT_UI4, VT_I4, VT_UI8, VT_I8, VT_R4, VT_R8, VT_BOOL, VT_BSTR, and VT_UNKNOWN (for a specialized set of IUnknown derived types as indicated by the enumeration ModelObjectKind. 

[CreateTypedIntrinsicObject](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/dbgmodel/nf-dbgmodel-idatamodelmanager-createtypedintrinsicobject)

The CreateTypedintrinsicObject method is similar to the CreateIntrinsicObject method excepting that it allows a native/language type to be associated with the data and carried along with the boxed value. This allows the data model to represent constructs such as native enumeration types (which are simply VT_UI* or VT_I* values). Pointer types are also created with this method. A native pointer in the data model is a zero extended 64-bit quantity representing an offset into the virtual address space of the debug target. It is boxed inside a VT_UI8 and is created with this method and a type which indicates a native/language pointer. 

[CreateMetadataStore](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/dbgmodel/nf-dbgmodel-idatamodelmanager-createmetadatastore)

The CreateMetadataStore method creates a key store -- a simplified container of key/value/metadata tuples -- which is used to hold metadata that can be associated with properties and a variety of other values. 
A metadata store may have a single parent (which in turn can have a single parent). If a given metadata key is not located in a given store, its parents are checked. Most metadata stores do not have parents. It does, however, provide a way of sharing common metadata easily. 

[CreateTypedIntrinsicObjectEx](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/dbgmodel/nf-dbgmodel-idatamodelmanager2-createtypedintrinsicobjectex)

The CreateTypedIntrinsicObjectEx method is semantically similar to the CreateTypedIntrinsicObject method. The only difference between the two is that this method allows the caller to specify the context in which the intrinsic data is valid. If no context is passed, the data is considered valid in whatever context is inherited from the type argument (how CreateTypedIntrinsicObject behaves). This allows for the creation of typed pointer values in the debug target which require more specific context than can be inherited from the type. 

**Extensibility / Registration Methods**
The following set of methods manages the extensibility mechanism of the data model, allowing a client to extend or register existing models or ask the data model to automatically attach a given parent model on native types which match a given criterion.

```cpp
    STDMETHOD(GetModelForTypeSignature)(_In_ IDebugHostTypeSignature* typeSignature, _Out_ IModelObject** dataModel) PURE;
    STDMETHOD(GetModelForType)(_In_ IDebugHostType* type, _COM_Outptr_ IModelObject** dataModel, _COM_Outptr_opt_ IDebugHostTypeSignature** typeSignature, _COM_Outptr_opt_ IDebugHostSymbolEnumerator** wildcardMatches) PURE;
    STDMETHOD(RegisterModelForTypeSignature)(_In_ IDebugHostTypeSignature* typeSignature, _In_ IModelObject* dataModel) PURE;
    STDMETHOD(UnregisterModelForTypeSignature)(_In_ IModelObject* dataModel, _In_opt_ IDebugHostTypeSignature* typeSignature) PURE;
    STDMETHOD(RegisterExtensionForTypeSignature)(_In_ IDebugHostTypeSignature* typeSignature, _In_ IModelObject* dataModel) PURE;
    STDMETHOD(UnregisterExtensionForTypeSignature)(_In_ IModelObject* dataModel, _In_opt_ IDebugHostTypeSignature* typeSignature) PURE;
    STDMETHOD(GetRootNamespace)(_COM_Outptr_ IModelObject** rootNamespace) PURE;
    STDMETHOD(RegisterNamedModel)(_In_ PCWSTR modelName, _In_ IModelObject *modeObject) PURE;
    STDMETHOD(UnregisterNamedModel)(_In_ PCWSTR modelName) PURE;
    STDMETHOD(AcquireNamedModel)(_In_ PCWSTR modelName, _COM_Outptr_ IModelObject **modelObject) PURE;
```

[GetModelForTypeSignature](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/dbgmodel/nf-dbgmodel-idatamodelmanager-getmodelfortypesignature)

The GetModelForTypeSignature method returns the data model that was registered against a particular type signature via a prior call to the RegisterModelForTypeSignature method. The data model returned from this method is considered the canonical visualizer for any type which matches the passed type signature. As a canonical visualizer, that data model takes over the display of the type. Display engines will, by default, hide native/language constructs of the object in favor of the view of the object presented by the data model. 


[GetModelForType](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/dbgmodel/nf-dbgmodel-idatamodelmanager-getmodelfortype)

The GetModelForType method returns the data model which is the canonical visualizer for a given type instance. In effect, this method finds the best matching type signature which was registered with a prior call to the RegisterModelForTypeSignature method and returns the associated data model. 

[RegisterModelForTypeSignature](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/dbgmodel/nf-dbgmodel-idatamodelmanager-registermodelfortypesignature)

The RegisterModelForTypeSignature method is the primary method that a caller utilizes to register a canonical visualizer for a given type (or set of types). A canonical visualizer is a data model which, in effect, takes over the display of a given type (or set of types). Instead of the native/language view of the type being displayed in any debugger user interface, the view of the type as presented by the registered data model is displayed (along with a means of getting back to the native/language view for a user who desires it). 

[UnregisterModelForTypeSignature](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/dbgmodel/nf-dbgmodel-idatamodelmanager-unregistermodelfortypesignature)

The UnregisterModelForTypeSignature method undoes a prior call to the RegisterModelForTypeSignature method. This method can either remove a given data model as the canonical visualizer for types matching a particular type signature or it can remove a given data model as the canonical visualizer for every type signature under which that data model is registered. 

[RegisterExtensionForTypeSignature](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/dbgmodel/nf-dbgmodel-idatamodelmanager-registerextensionfortypesignature)

The RegisterExtensionForTypeSignature method is similar to the RegisterModelForTypeSignature method with one key difference. The data model which is passed to this method is not the canonical visualizer for any type and it will not take over the display of the native/language view of that type. The data model which is passed to this method will automatically be added as a parent to any concrete type which matches the supplied type signature. 
Unlike the RegisterModelForTypeSignature method, there is no limit on identical or ambiguous type signatures being registered as extensions to a given type (or set of types). Every extension whose type signature matches a given concrete type instance will cause the data model registered via this method to automatically be attached to newly created objects as parent models. This, in effect, allows an arbitrary number of clients to extend a type (or set of types) with new fields or functionality. 

[UnregisterExtensionForTypeSignature](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/dbgmodel/nf-dbgmodel-idatamodelmanager-unregisterextensionfortypesignature)

The UnregisterExtensionForTypeSignature method undoes a prior call to RegisterExtensionForTypeSignature. It unregisters a particular data model as an extension for either a particular type signature or as an extension for all type signatures against which the data model was registered. 

[GetRootNamespace](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/dbgmodel/nf-dbgmodel-idatamodelmanager-getrootnamespace)

The GetRootNamespace method returns the data model's root namespace. This is an object which the data model manages and into which the debug host places certain objects.

[RegisterNamedModel](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/dbgmodel/nf-dbgmodel-idatamodelmanager2-registernamedmodel)

The RegisterNamedModel method registers a given data model under a well known name so that it can be found by clients wishing to extend it. This is the primary purpose of the API -- to publish a data model as something which can be extended by retrieving the model registered under this well known name and adding a parent model to it. 

[UnregisterNamedModel](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/dbgmodel/nf-dbgmodel-idatamodelmanager2-unregisternamedmodel)

The UnregisterNamedModel method undoes a prior call to RegisterNamedModel. It removes the association between a data model and a name under which it can be looked up.

[AcquireNamedModel](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/dbgmodel/nf-dbgmodel-idatamodelmanager-acquirenamedmodel)

A caller who wishes to extend a data model which is registered under a given name calls the AcquireNamedModel method in order to retrieve the object for the data model they wish to extend. This method will return whatever data model was registered via a prior call to the RegisterNamedModel method. 
As the primary purpose of the AcquireNamedModel method is to extend the model, this method has a special behavior if no model has been registered under the given name yet. If no model has been registered under the given name yet, a stub object is created, temporarily registered under the given name, and returned to the caller. When the real data model is registered via a call to the RegisterNamedModel method, any changes which were made to the stub object are, in effect, made to the real model. This removes many load order dependency issues from components which extend each other. 

**Helper Methods**

The following methods are general helper methods which assist in performing complex operations on objects in the data model. While it is possible to perform these actions via other methods on the data model or its objects, these convenience methods make it significantly easier: 

```cpp
STDMETHOD(AcquireSubNamespace)(_In_ PCWSTR modelName, _In_ PCWSTR subNamespaceModelName, _In_ PCWSTR accessName, _In_opt_ IKeyStore *metadata, _COM_Outptr_ IModelObject **namespaceModelObject) PURE;
```

[AcquireSubNamespace](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/dbgmodel/nf-dbgmodel-idatamodelmanager2-acquiresubnamespace)

The AcquireSubNamespace method helps in the construction of something which might more traditionally look like a language namespace than a new object in a dynamic language. If, for instance, a caller wishes to categorize properties on a process object to make the process object more organized and the properties easier to discover, one method of doing this would be to create a sub-object for each category on the process object and placing those properties inside that object.
