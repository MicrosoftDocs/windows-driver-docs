# Bug Check 0x1C4: DRIVER\_VERIFIER\_DETECTED\_VIOLATION\_LIVEDUMP

The DRIVER\_VERIFIER\_DETECTED\_VIOLATION\_LIVEDUMP live dump has a value of 0x000001C4. This indicates that a device driver attempting to corrupt the system has been detected. This is because the driver was specified in the registry as being suspect (by the administrator) and the kernel has enabled substantial checking of this driver. For more information, see [Driver Verifier](../devtest/driver-verifier.md).

## DRIVER\_VERIFIER\_DETECTED\_VIOLATION\_LIVEDUMP Parameters

| Parameter | Description                              |
|-----------|------------------------------------------|
|1| The subclass of driver violation. See Values below.|
|2| See Values below. |
|3| See Values below. |
|4| See Values below. |

(This code can never be used for a real bug check; it is used to identify live dumps.)
