## MICROCODE\_REVISION\_MISMATCH Parameters

|Parameter|Description|
|-------- |---------- |
|1| The processor CPUID signature value of the processor that mismatched. |
|2| The expected microcode revision for the processor. |
|3| The actual, reported microcode revision for the processor. |
|4| The processor index of the mismatching processor.|


## Cause
One or more processors in the multiprocessor configuration have inconsistent microcode loaded. 
This bugcheck indicates that faulty system firmware has mistakenly applied a microcode update to only a subset of processors in the host configuration. System firmware must apply microcode updates to all processors in a uniform fashion.
