# Bug Check 0x16B: CLUSTER\_CSV\_CLUSTER\_WATCHDOG\_LIVEDUMP

The CLUSTER\_CSV\_CLUSTER\_WATCHDOG\_LIVEDUMP live dump has a value of 0x0000016B. This indicates that the Cluster service user mode watchdog detected that a thread is not making forward progress for a long time.

## CLUSTER\_CSV\_CLUSTER\_WATCHDOG\_LIVEDUMP Parameters

|Parameter|Description|
|--- |--- |
|1| Cluster Service PID.|
|2| Id of the thread that is stuck.|
|3| Reserved.|
|4| Reserved.|

## Cause

The Cluster service user mode watchdog detected that a thread is not making forward progress for a long time.

The system generated a live dump for analysis of the delay.

(This code can never be used for a real bug check; it is used to identify live dumps.)
