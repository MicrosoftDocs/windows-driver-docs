## MSRPC\_STATE\_VIOLATION Parameters


Parameters 1 and 2 are the only parameters of interest. Parameter 1 indicates the state violation type; the value for Parameter 2 is determined by the value of Parameter 1.

## Cause

The most common cause of this bug check is that the caller of the Msrpc.sys driver violated the state semantics for such a call.
