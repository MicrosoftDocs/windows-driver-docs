## DRIVER\_VIOLATION Parameters

Parameter 1 indicates the type of violation.

| Parameter 1 | Parameter 2       | Parameter 3         | Parameter 4 | Cause                                                                       |
|-------------|-------------------|---------------------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0x1 | The current IRQL. | The required IRQL.          | Reserved    | A driver has called a function which can only be called at a specific IRQL. |
| 0x2 | The current IRQL. | The maximum allowable IRQL. | Reserved    | A driver has called a function at a greater IRQL than the function can be called at. |

## Remarks

Use a kernel debugger and view the call stack to determine the name of the driver that caused the violation: the [**!analyze**](../debuggercmds/-analyze.md) debug extension displays information about the bug check and can be helpful in determining the root cause, then enter one of the [**k (Display Stack Backtrace)**](../debuggercmds/k--kb--kc--kd--kp--kp--kv--display-stack-backtrace-.md) commands to view the call stack.
