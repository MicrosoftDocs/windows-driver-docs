# Install the Windows debugger

WinDbg is a debugger that can be used to analyze crash dumps, debug live user-mode and kernel-mode code, and examine CPU registers and memory.

This latest version features a more modern user experience with an updated interface, fully-fledged scripting capabilities, an extensible debugging data model, built-in Time Travel Debugging (TTD) support, and many additional features.
