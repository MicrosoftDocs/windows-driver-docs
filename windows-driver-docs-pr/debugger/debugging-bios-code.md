# Debugging BIOS Code


## <span id="ddk_debugging_bios_code_dbg"></span><span id="DDK_DEBUGGING_BIOS_CODE_DBG"></span>


BIOS code is not built from standard assembly code, so it requires different debugging techniques.

On an x86-based processor, the BIOS uses 16-bit code. To disassemble this code, use the [**ux (Unassemble x86 BIOS)**](../debuggercmds/ux--unassemble-x86-bios-.md) command. To display information about the Intel Multiprocessor Specification (MPS), use the [**!mps**](../debuggercmds/-mps.md) extension.

If you are debugging ACPI BIOS code, the preceding commands do not work, because ACPI BIOS is written in ACPI Machine Language (AML). To disassemble this code, you should use [**!amli u**](../debuggercmds/-amli-u.md). For more information about this kind of debugging, see [ACPI Debugging](acpi-debugging.md).
