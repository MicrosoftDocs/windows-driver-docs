# Debugging resources

Use Debugging Tools for Windows to debug drivers, applications, and services on Windows systems. The core debugging engine in the tool set is called the Windows debugger. You can use the traditional interfaces (WinDbg, CDB, and NTSD), which are included in Debugging Tools for Windows as part of the WDK.
