Click **Call Stack** on the **View** menu to open the [Calls window](calls-window.md). If this window is already open, it becomes active.

This command is equivalent to pressing ALT+6 or clicking the **Call stack (Alt+6)** button (![screen shot of the call stack button](images/tbcall.png)) on the toolbar.

For more information about this window and its uses, see [Calls Window](calls-window.md).
