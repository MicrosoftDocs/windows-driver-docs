# File | Open Workspace


## <span id="ddk_file_open_workspace_dbg"></span><span id="DDK_FILE_OPEN_WORKSPACE_DBG"></span>


Click **Open Workspace** on the **File** menu to open a saved workspace.

This command is equivalent to pressing CTRL+W.

### <span id="dialog_box"></span><span id="DIALOG_BOX"></span>Dialog Box

When you click **Open Workspace**, the **Open Workspace** dialog box appears. This dialog box contains a list of all named workspaces in the **Workspaces** area. Default or implicit workspaces are not listed since opening them directly will cause problems with the implicit ordering. If you want to open an implicit workspace directly, you must save it explicitly. For more information on named and default workspaces, see [Creating and Opening a Workspace](creating-and-opening-a-workspace.md).

Enter the name of the workspace that you want to open in the **Workspace** box or select the workspace name in the **Workspaces** area. Then, click **OK** to open the selected workspace, or click **Cancel** to return the debugger to its previous state.

For more information about the different levels of workspaces and how to use them, see [Using Workspaces](using-workspaces.md).
