# General Tips for Blue Screens

> [!NOTE]
> This topic is for programmers. If you are a customer whose system has displayed a blue screen with a bug check code, see [Troubleshoot blue screen errors](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=183646).

**Note**   If you are an IT professional or support agent, see this article for additional information, [Troubleshoot "blue screen" or Stop error problems before you contact Microsoft Support](https://support.microsoft.com/help/3106831/).

If your computer stops working and displays a blue screen, the computer has shut down abruptly to protect itself from data loss. A hardware device, its driver, or related software might have caused this error. To learn more about the information that is displayed, such as the faulting driver name, see [Blue Screen Data](blue-screen-data.md).
