# General Tips for Blue Screens


If your computer stops working and displays a blue screen, the computer has shut down abruptly to protect itself from data loss. A hardware device, its driver, or related software might have caused this error. If your copy of Windows came with your computer, you may want to contact the manufacturer of your computer.

If you have experience with computers and want to try to recover from this error, follow the steps described in [Troubleshoot blue screen errors](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=183646).
