## Cause

Several processes and threads are necessary for the operation of the system. When they are terminated for any reason, the system can no longer function.

 
## Resolution

The [**!analyze**](../debuggercmds/-analyze.md) debug extension displays information about the bug check and can be helpful in determining the root cause.
