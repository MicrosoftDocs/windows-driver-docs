# Bug Check 0x79: MISMATCHED\_HAL


The MISMATCHED\_HAL bug check has a value of 0x00000079. This bug check indicates that the Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) revision level or configuration does not match that of the kernel or the computer.

When Parameter 1 equals 0x2, the following build type codes are used:

-   0: Multiprocessor-enabled free build

-   1: Multiprocessor-enabled checked build

-   2: Single-processor free build

-   3: Single-processor checked build

## Cause

The MISMATCHED\_HAL bug check often occurs when a user manually updates Ntoskrnl.exe or Hal.dll.

The error can also indicate that one of those two files is out of date. Or the computer might erroneously have a multiprocessor HAL and a single-processor kernel installed, or vice versa.

The Ntoskrnl.exe kernel file is for single-processor systems and Ntkrnlmp.exe is for multiprocessor systems. However, these file names correspond to the files on the installation media.After you have installed the Windows operating system, the file is renamed to Ntoskrnl.exe, regardless of the source file that is used. The HAL file also uses the name Hal.dll after installation, but there are several possible HAL files on the installation media on older versions of Windows.

## Resolution

Restart the computer by using the product CD or the Windows Setup disks. At the Welcome screen, press F10 to start the Recovery Console. Use the **Copy** command to copy the correct HAL or kernel file from the original CD into the appropriate folder on the hard disk. The **Copy** command detects whether the file that you are copying is in the Microsoft compressed file format. If so, it automatically expands the file that is copied on the target drive.
