# <span id="debugger.performing_kernel-mode_debugging_using_kd"></span>Live Kernel-Mode Debugging Using KD


In a Command Prompt window, you can initiate a live kernel-mode debugging session when you launch KD. Enter one of the following commands.

kd \[-y *SymbolPath*\] -k net:port=*PortNumber*,key=*Key*\[,target=*TargetIPAddress*|*TargetHostName*\] 

kd \[-y *SymbolPath*\] -k 1394:channel=*1394Channel*\[,symlink=*1394Protocol*\]

kd \[-y *SymbolPath*\] -k usb:targetname=*USBString*

kd \[-y *SymbolPath*\] -k com:port=*ComPort*,baud=*BaudRate*

kd \[-y *SymbolPath*\] -k com:ipport=*SerialTcpIpPort*,port=*SerialIPAddress*

kd \[-y *SymbolPath*\] -k com:pipe,port=\\\\*VMHost*\\pipe\\*PipeName*\[,resets=0\]\[,reconnect\]

kd \[-y *SymbolPath*\] -k com:*modem*

kd \[-y *SymbolPath*\] -kl

kd \[-y *SymbolPath*\] -k

For more information, see [**KD Command-Line Options**](kd-command-line-options.md).

### <span id="Environment_Variables"></span><span id="environment_variables"></span><span id="ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES"></span>Environment Variables

For debugging over a serial (COM port) or 1394 connection, you can use environment variables to specify the connection settings.

Use the following variables to specify a serial connection.

set \_NT\_DEBUG\_PORT = *ComPort*

set \_NT\_DEBUG\_BAUD\_RATE = *BaudRate*

Use the following variables to specify a 1394 connection.

set \_NT\_DEBUG\_BUS = 1394

set \_NT\_DEBUG\_1394\_CHANNEL = *1394Channel* 

set \_NT\_DEBUG\_1394\_SYMLINK = *1394Protocol*

For more information, see [Kernel-Mode Environment Variables](kernel-mode-environment-variables.md).

### <span id="ddk__devobj_dbg"></span><span id="DDK__DEVOBJ_DBG"></span>Parameters

<span id="_______SymbolPath______"></span><span id="_______symbolpath______"></span><span id="_______SYMBOLPATH______"></span> *SymbolPath*   
A list of directories where symbol files are located. Directories in the list are separated by semicolons. For more information, see [Symbol Path](symbol-path.md).

<span id="_______PortNumber______"></span><span id="_______portnumber______"></span><span id="_______PORTNUMBER______"></span> *PortNumber*   
A port number to use for network debugging. You can choose any number from 49152 through 65535. For more information, see [Setting Up a Network Connection Manually](setting-up-a-network-debugging-connection.md).

<span id="_______Key______"></span><span id="_______key______"></span><span id="_______KEY______"></span> *Key*   
The encryption key to use for network debugging. We recommend that you use an automatically generated key, which is provided by bcdedit when you configure the target computer. For more information, see [Setting Up a Network Connection Manually](setting-up-a-network-debugging-connection.md).


<span id="_______TargetIp______"></span><span id="_______targetip______"></span><span id="_______TARGETIP______"></span> *TargetIPAddress*   
The IPv4 address of the target machine. 

When the target= IP address is specified, this causes the debugger to initiate a connection to the specified target machine, by sending a special packet to the target, that will cause it to attempt to connect with that debugger. The debugger will send packets to the target repeatedly approximately every half second, attempting to connect. If the connection is successful, the target will drop any existing connection, and communicate only with this instance of the debugger. This allows you to take control of the debugging session away from an existing debugging connection. 

When the target is configured with a host IP address, and the debugger is being run on the machine with the configured host IP address, there is no need to specify the target= IP address parameter. When the target is configured with a host IP address, it will send OFFER packets to the host every three seconds.  The OFFER packets allow the debugger to connect to the host when no target= IP address is specified.

For more information on configuring the host IP address on the target, see [Setting Up KDNET Network Kernel Debugging Automatically](setting-up-a-network-debugging-connection-automatically.md) and [Setting Up KDNET Network Kernel Debugging Manually](setting-up-a-network-debugging-connection.md).


<span id="_______TargetName______"></span><span id="_______targetname______"></span><span id="_______TARGETNAME______"></span> *TargetMachineName*   
The machine name of the target PC. To use the machine name, the DNS system on the network must have the machine name associated with the IP address of the target PC.
 
<span id="_______1394Channel______"></span><span id="_______1394channel______"></span><span id="_______1394CHANNEL______"></span> *1394Channel*   
The 1394 channel number. Valid channel numbers are any integer between 0 and 62, inclusive. *1394Channel* must match the number used by the target computer, but does not depend on the physical 1394 port chosen on the adapter. For more information, see [Setting Up a 1394 Connection Manually](setting-up-a-1394-cable-connection.md).

<span id="_______1394Protocol______"></span><span id="_______1394protocol______"></span><span id="_______1394PROTOCOL______"></span> *1394Protocol*   
The connection protocol to be used for the 1394 kernel connection. This can almost always be omitted, because the debugger will automatically choose the correct protocol. If you wish to set this manually, and the target computer is running Windows XP, *1394Protocol* should be set equal to "channel". If the target computer is running Windows Server 2003 or later, *1394Protocol* should be set equal to "instance". If it is omitted, the debugger will default to the protocol appropriate for the current target computer. This can only be specified through the command line or the environment variables, not through the WinDbg graphical interface.

<span id="_______USBString______"></span><span id="_______usbstring______"></span><span id="_______USBSTRING______"></span> *USBString*   
A USB connection string. This must match the string specified with the /targetname boot option. For more information, see [Setting Up a USB 3.0 Connection Manually](setting-up-a-usb-3-0-debug-cable-connection.md) and [Setting Up a USB 2.0 Connection Manually](setting-up-a-usb-2-0-debug-cable-connection.md).

<span id="_______ComPort______"></span><span id="_______comport______"></span><span id="_______COMPORT______"></span> *ComPort*   
The name of the COM port. This can be in the format "com2" or in the format "\\\\.\\com2", but should not simply be a number. For more information, see [Setting Up a Serial Connection Manually](setting-up-a-null-modem-cable-connection.md).

<span id="_______BaudRate______"></span><span id="_______baudrate______"></span><span id="_______BAUDRATE______"></span> *BaudRate*   
The baud rate. This can be 9600, 19200, 38400, 57600, or 115200.

<span id="_______VMHost______"></span><span id="_______vmhost______"></span><span id="_______VMHOST______"></span> *VMHost*   
When debugging a virtual machine, *VMHost* specifies the name of the physical computer on which the virtual machine is running. If the virtual machine is running on the same computer as the kernel debugger itself, use a single period (.) for *VMHost*. For more information, see [Setting Up a Connection to a Virtual Machine](attaching-to-a-virtual-machine--kernel-mode-.md).

<span id="_______PipeName______"></span><span id="_______pipename______"></span><span id="_______PIPENAME______"></span> *PipeName*   
The name of the pipe created by the virtual machine for the debugging connection.

<span id="_______resets_0"></span><span id="_______RESETS_0"></span> resets=0  
Specifies that an unlimited number of reset packets can be sent to the target when the host and target are synchronizing. This parameter is only needed when debugging certain kinds of virtual machines.

<span id="_______reconnect"></span><span id="_______RECONNECT"></span> reconnect  
Causes the debugger to automatically disconnect and reconnect the pipe if a read/write failure occurs. Additionally, if the named pipe is not found when the debugger is started, the reconnect parameter will cause it to wait for a pipe of this name to appear. This parameter is only needed when debugging certain kinds of virtual machines.

<span id="_______-kl"></span><span id="_______-KL"></span> -kl  
Causes the debugger to perform local kernel-mode debugging. For more information, see [Local Kernel-Mode Debugging](performing-local-kernel-debugging.md).

<span id="SerialTcpIpPort"> *SerialTcpIpPort*   
The target TCP IP port of the emulated serial COM port. 

<span id="SerialIPAddress"> *SerialIPAddress*   
The target TCP IP address of the emulated serial COM port. 


### <span id="Examples"></span><span id="examples"></span><span id="EXAMPLES"></span>Examples

The following batch file could be used to set up and start a debugging session over a COM port connection.

```console
set _NT_SYMBOL_PATH=d:\mysymbols
set _NT_DEBUG_PORT=com1
set _NT_DEBUG_BAUD_RATE=115200
set _NT_DEBUG_LOG_FILE_OPEN=d:\debuggers\logfile1.log
kd
```

The following batch file could be used to set up and start a debugging session over a 1394 connection.

```console
set _NT_SYMBOL_PATH=d:\mysymbols
set _NT_DEBUG_BUS=1394
set _NT_DEBUG_1394_CHANNEL=44
set _NT_DEBUG_LOG_FILE_OPEN=d:\debuggers\logfile1.log
kd
```

The following command lines could be used to start WinDbg without any environment variables.

**kd -y d:\\mysymbols -k com:port=com2,baud=57600**

**kd -y d:\\mysymbols -k com:port=\\\\.\\com2,baud=115200**

**kd -y d:\\mysymbols -k 1394:channel=20,symlink=instance**

**kd -y d:\\mysymbols -k net:port=50000,key=**<em>AutoGeneratedKey</em>
