# Configuring the Registry

SymProxy stores its settings in this registry key.

```reg
HKLM/Software/Microsoft/Symbol Server Proxy
```

This registry key controls the location from which to find symbols to store in the Web site, the logging level, and whether or not SymProxy operates with a direct connection to the network. You can create this key by running the SymProxy registration tool (Symproxy.reg) provided with Debugging Tools for Windows. Type **symproxy.reg** at the command prompt or double-click it from Windows Explorer.

This will add entries for the settings that will be prefixed with an "x" so that they are disabled. To enable a setting, remove the "x" from in front of the desired setting.

```reg
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Symbol Server Proxy]
"Available Settings"="Remove the 'x' prefix to use the setting"
"xMissAgeTimeout"=dword:00015180
"xMissAgeCheck"=dword:00000e10
"xMissTimeout"=dword:00000e10
"xNoCache"=dword:00000001
"xNoFilePointers"=dword:00000001
"xNoInternetProxy"=dword:00000001
"xNoLongerIndexedAuthoritive"=dword:00000001
"xNoUncompress"=dword:00000001
"xRequestTimeout"=dword:0000019
"xRetryAppHang"=dword:0000002
"xUriFilter"=dword:00000FF
"xUriTiers"=dword:0000001
```

The symproxy.reg registry file assumes a virtual directory name of Symbols and configures the Symbol Path to use the Microsoft Public Symbol Server.

```reg
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Symbol Server Proxy\Web Directories]

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Symbol Server Proxy\Web Directories\Symbols]
"SymbolPath"="https://msdl.microsoft.com/download/symbols"
```

The event logging entries in symproxy.reg are covered latter in the Event Log section of this topic.

```reg
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\EventLog\Application\Microsoft-Windows-SymProxy]
"ProviderGuid"="{0876099c-a903-47ff-af14-52035bb479ef}"
"EventMessageFile"=hex(2):25,00,53,00,79,00,73,00,74,00,65,00,6d,00,52,00,6f,\
  00,6f,00,74,00,25,00,5c,00,73,00,79,00,73,00,74,00,65,00,6d,00,33,00,32,00,\
  5c,00,69,00,6e,00,65,00,74,00,73,00,72,00,76,00,5c,00,53,00,79,00,6d,00,50,\
  00,72,00,6f,00,78,00,79,00,2e,00,64,00,6c,00,6c,00,00,00
"TypesSupported"=dword:00000007
```

The web directory entries in symproxy.reg are discussed in this topic.

### <span id="web_directories"></span><span id="WEB_DIRECTORIES"></span>Web Directories

For each virtual directory generated in IIS that you are using as a symbol store, you must setup a registry key below the **Web Directories** subkey of the following registry key.

```reg
HKLM/Software/Microsoft/Symbol Server Proxy
```

**To edit the registry key for a symbol store virtual directory**

-   Edit the contents of **SymbolPath** to contain all of the symbol stores used by the SymProxy symbol store. If there is more than one symbol store being used, separate them with semicolons. A maximum of 10 stores is supported for each value. HTTP paths must include the **https:// prefix**, and UNC paths must include the **\\\\** prefix.

For example, if one of the virtual directories is called Symbols, and the symbols stores that it accesses are located at the UNC store \\\\symbols\\symbols and the HTTP store https://msdl.microsoft.com/download/symbols, create the following registry key.

```reg
HKLM/Software/Microsoft/Symbol Server Proxy/Web Directories/Symbols
```

After this key is created, edit its **SymbolPath** to be \\\\symbols\\symbols;<https://msdl.microsoft.com/download/symbols>. This can be seen in the following screenshot of the Registry Editor.

:::image type="content" source="images/symproxy-registry.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Registry Editor displaying an updated SymbolPath.":::

In this example, SymProxy first searches for symbols in \\\\symbols\\symbols. If the files are not found there, the Microsoft Symbol Store will be used.

-   In each of the keys under Web Directories that match the Virtual Directory names, a REG\_SZ called SymbolPath needs to be created. The value contains all the upstream symbol stores that will be used to populate the SymProxy symbol store.

-   A maximum of 10 entries are supported.

-   Separate entries with semicolons.

-   UNC paths need to include the “\\\\” prefix

-   HTTP paths need to include the “https://” prefix

-   Order the values from least expensive to most expensive.

    - You will need to balance usage performance goals vs. server and data communications costs in the calculation.

    - In general, put local SMB/HTTP servers before internet HTTP servers.

### <span id="SymProxy_Performance_Counters"></span><span id="symproxy_performance_counters"></span><span id="SYMPROXY_PERFORMANCE_COUNTERS"></span>SymProxy Performance Counters

SymProxy can emit performance counters via a provider called SymProxy.

To enable the performance counters support, register the symproxy manifest file in an administrator command window:

```console
C:\> lodctr.exe /m:%WINDIR%\system32\inetsrv\symproxy.man
```

To disable the performance counters support, unregister the manifest:

```console
C:\> unlodctr.exe /m:%WINDIR%\system32\inetsrv\symproxy.man
```

### <span id="SymProxy_Event_Tracing_for_Windows"></span><span id="symproxy_event_tracing_for_windows"></span><span id="SYMPROXY_EVENT_TRACING_FOR_WINDOWS"></span>SymProxy Event Tracing for Windows

SymProxy can create ETW events via a provider called Microsoft-Windows-SymProxy.

```console
C:\> logman query providers | findstr SymProxy
Microsoft-Windows-SymProxy {0876099C-A903-47FF-AF14-52035BB479EF}
```

To enable the ETW support, register the manifest file:

```console
C:\> wevtutil.exe install-manifest %WINDIR%\system32\inetsrv\symproxy.man
```

To disable the ETW support, unregister the manifest file:

```console
C:\> wevtutil.exe uninstall-manifest %WINDIR%\system32\inetsrv\symproxy.man
```

### <span id="Event_Log"></span><span id="event_log"></span><span id="EVENT_LOG"></span>Event Log

If ETW is configured, the events are recorded as events in the *Operational and Analytic* channels under *Applications and Services Logs\\Microsoft\\Windows\\SymProxy* in the Event Log.

To correctly view the message of the Event Log entries, the Event Log area of the symproxy.reg file needs to be added to the registry:

```reg
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\EventLog\Application\Microsoft-Windows-SymProxy]
"ProviderGuid"="{0876099c-a903-47ff-af14-52035bb479ef}"
"EventMessageFile"=hex(2):25,00,53,00,79,00,73,00,74,00,65,00,6d,00,52,00,6f,\
  00,6f,00,74,00,25,00,5c,00,73,00,79,00,73,00,74,00,65,00,6d,00,33,00,32,00,\
  5c,00,69,00,6e,00,65,00,74,00,73,00,72,00,76,00,5c,00,53,00,79,00,6d,00,50,\
  00,72,00,6f,00,78,00,79,00,2e,00,64,00,6c,00,6c,00,00,00
"TypesSupported"=dword:00000007
```

### <span id="SymProxy_Events"></span><span id="symproxy_events"></span><span id="SYMPROXY_EVENTS"></span>SymProxy Events

SymProxy logs the following events:

| **Event ID** | **Description**                   | **Channel** |

### <span id="Symbol_Server_Proxy_Configuration"></span><span id="symbol_server_proxy_configuration"></span><span id="SYMBOL_SERVER_PROXY_CONFIGURATION"></span>Symbol Server Proxy Configuration

SymProxy stores its configuration settings in the following registry key area:

```reg
HKLM/Software/Microsoft/Symbol Server Proxy
```

From this location, SymProxy acquires its global settings and the symbol paths of upstream symbol stores.

You can create this key by merging in the symproxy.reg file you customized as discussed earlier.

### <span id="Symbol_Server_Proxy__key"></span><span id="symbol_server_proxy__key"></span><span id="SYMBOL_SERVER_PROXY__KEY"></span>Symbol Server Proxy Key

The Symbol Server Proxy registry key supports the following global settings (all REG\_DWORD). Settings can be applied live by recycling the application pool. A new w3wp.exe process will be created and it will read the new values. Once all pending requests to the old w3wp.exe process have completed, the old w3wp.exe process will end. IIS by default recycles w3wp.exe processes every 1,740 minutes (29 hours).

### <span id="accessing_outside_network_resources"></span><span id="ACCESSING_OUTSIDE_NETWORK_RESOURCES"></span>Accessing Outside Network Resources

When SymSrv is used in conjunction with SymProxy, it runs as a service and uses the WinHTTP API to access symbols over an HTTP connection. This differs from its usual behavior of using WinInet for this purpose.

Consequently, you may need to set up HTTP proxy settings so that this service can access outside network resources. Use one of the following methods to configure these settings:

- Use the Netsh tool (netsh.exe). For instructions, type the following in a Command Prompt window:

    ```console
    netsh winhttp -? 
    ```

The default behavior of SymProxy is to use whatever HTTP proxy is designated by either ProxyCfg or Netsh. If no HTTP proxy is configured, SymProxy uses a dummy proxy to allow access to secure HTTP sites within your intranet. As a side effect, this technique prevents SymProxy from working with direct connections to the external Internet. If you wish to permit SymProxy to operate with a direct connection to the Internet, create a REG\_DWORD value named **NoInternetProxy** in the **Symbol Server Proxy** key of your registry. Set the value of **NoInternetProxy** to 1 and verify that there is no HTTP proxy indicated by ProxyCfg.
