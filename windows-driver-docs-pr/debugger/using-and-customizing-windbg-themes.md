# Using and Customizing WinDbg Themes - WinDbg (Classic)


A theme is a preconfigured WinDbg workspace that contains a useful configuration of debugging information windows.

Any theme can be saved as your base workspace. Themes in the Debugging Tools for Windows package are provided as a set of registry files (with the .reg extension). As you accumulate more debugging sessions, various default workspaces are automatically set up. These default workspaces use the base workspace as a starting point. For more information on default workspaces, see [Creating and Opening a Workspace](creating-and-opening-a-workspace.md).

For the best user experience, we recommend that you follow the instructions in this topic before starting your debugging session.
