# Window | Automatically Open Disassembly


## <span id="ddk_window_automatically_open_disassembly_dbg"></span><span id="DDK_WINDOW_AUTOMATICALLY_OPEN_DISASSEMBLY_DBG"></span>


Select **Automatically Open Disassembly** on the **Window** menu to cause the [Disassembly window](disassembly-window.md) to open every time WinDbg begins a debugging session.

If you clear this command, you can still open the Disassembly window by clicking **Disassembly** on the **View** menu, pressing ALT+7, or clicking the **Disassembly (Alt+F7)** button (![screen shot of the disassembly button](images/tbdisasm2.png)) on the toolbar.
