# Searching for KD Connection Servers


You can use KD or CDB with the **-QR** command-line option to obtain a list of available KD connection servers that are running on a network server.

This list may include servers that no longer exist but which were not shut down properly -- connecting to one of these generates an error message. The list will also include debugging servers and user-mode process servers. The server type will be indicated in each case.

The syntax for this is as follows:

```console
Debugger -QR \\Server 
```

## <span id="ddk_searching_for_kd_connection_servers_dbg"></span><span id="DDK_SEARCHING_FOR_KD_CONNECTION_SERVERS_DBG"></span>


*Debugger* can be either KD or CDB -- the display will be the same in either case. The two backslashes (**\\\\**) preceding *Server* are optional.

In WinDbg, you can use the **Connect to Remote Stub Server** dialog box to browse a list of available KD connection servers.

**Note**  For a KD connection server to be discoverable, it must be activated with elevated privileges. For more information, see [Activating a KD Connection Server](activating-a-kd-connection-server.md).

 

**Note**  
If you are not logged on to the client computer with an account that has access to the server computer, you might need to provide a user name and password. On the client computer, in a Command Prompt window, enter the following command.

**net use \\\\**<em>Server</em>**\\ipc$ /user:**<em>UserName</em>
where *Server* is the name of the server computer, and *UserName* is the name of an account that has access to the server computer.

When you are prompted, enter the password for *UserName*.

After this command succeeds, you can discover KD connection servers (running on the server computer) by using **-QR** or **Connect to Remote Stub**.
