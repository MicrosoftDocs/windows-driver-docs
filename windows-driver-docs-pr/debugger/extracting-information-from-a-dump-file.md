# Extract information from a dump file

Some information, such as the name of the target computer, is easily available during live debugging. You can also debug a dump file to determine the information. This article explains how to extract information from a dump file.

## Find the computer name in a kernel-mode dump file

Use the [!peb](../debuggercmds/-peb.md) extension if you need to determine the name of the computer on which the crash dump was made. Look for the value of COMPUTERNAME in its output.

## Find the IP address in a kernel-mode dump file

To determine the IP address of the computer on which the crash dump was made, find a thread stack that shows some send or receive network activity. Open one of the send or receive packets. The IP address is visible in that packet.

## Find the process ID in a user-mode dump file

To determine the process ID of the target application from a user-mode dump file, use the [| (Process status)](../debuggercmds/---process-status-.md) command. This command displays all the processes being debugged at the time the dump was written. The process marked with a period (.) is the current process. Its process ID is given in hexadecimal after the **id:** notation.

## Integrate WER into applications

[Windows error reporting (WER)](/windows/desktop/wer/windows-error-reporting) information can be integrated into applications to provide other crash dump information. For more information, see [Using WER](/windows/desktop/wer/using-wer).
