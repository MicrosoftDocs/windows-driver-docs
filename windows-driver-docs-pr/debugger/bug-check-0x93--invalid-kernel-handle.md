## INVALID\_KERNEL\_HANDLE Parameters

|Parameter 1|Parameter 2|Parameter 3|Parameter 4|Cause of Error|
|--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |
|The handle that NtClose was called with |0                |0   | 0  | A protected handle was closed.|
|The handle that NtClose was called with |1                |0   | 0  | An invalid handle was closed or referenced.|
|The handle that was referenced          |The handle table |0   | 1  | The error occurred referencing an invalid kernel handle and bad handle detection was enabled.|

## Cause

The INVALID_KERNEL_HANDLE bug check indicates that some kernel code (for example, a server, redirector, or another driver) tried to close an invalid handle or a protected handle.

If parameter 4 has a value of 1, this indicates that the error occurred referencing an invalid kernel handle and bad handle detection was enabled.

This message occurs if kernel code attempts to close or reference a handle that is not a valid handle. Only invalid or protected handles passed to NtClose will cause this bugcheck, unless bad handle detection is enabled.
