## Cause

This bug check is caused by the file system as a last resort when its internal accounting is in an unsupportable state and to continue poses a large risk of data loss. The file system never causes this bug check when the on disk structures are corrupted, the disk sectors go bad, or a memory allocation fails. Bad sectors could lead to a bug check, for example, when a page fault occurs in kernel code or data and the memory manager cannot read the pages. However, for this bug check, the file system is not the cause.

## Resolution

**To debug this problem:** Use the [**.cxr (Display Context Record)**](../debuggercmds/-cxr--display-context-record-.md) command together with Parameter 3, and then use [**kb (Display Stack Backtrace)**](../debuggercmds/k--kb--kc--kd--kp--kp--kv--display-stack-backtrace-.md).
