# Window | MDI Emulation


Select **MDI Emulation** on the **Window** menu to cause WinDbg to emulate the Multiple Document Interface (MDI) style of windowing. This kind of windowing differs from docking mode because all windows are floating, but floating windows are constrained within the frame window. This behavior emulates the behavior of WinDbg before docking mode was introduced.

Clear **MDI Emulation** on the **Window** menu to return WinDbg to docking mode.
