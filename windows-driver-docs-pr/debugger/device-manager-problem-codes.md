# Device Manager Problem Codes


The Device Manager marks a device with a yellow exclamation mark (!) when the device has a problem. The problem codes are in the form CM\_PROB\_*XXX* and are defined in the header file cfg.h. The most important are explained here, together with their mapping to the [Device Node Status Flags](device-node-status-flags.md). For a more comprehensive list, please see [Device Manager Error Messages](../install/device-manager-error-messages.md).

<span id="Code_1__CM_PROB_NOT_CONFIGURED_"></span><span id="code_1__cm_prob_not_configured_"></span><span id="CODE_1__CM_PROB_NOT_CONFIGURED_"></span>**Code 1 (CM\_PROB\_NOT\_CONFIGURED)**  
Indicates that the device is not installed and was not installed previously. (Corresponds to DNF\_NOT\_CONFIGURED.)

<span id="Code_10__CM_PROB_FAILED_START_"></span><span id="code_10__cm_prob_failed_start_"></span><span id="CODE_10__CM_PROB_FAILED_START_"></span>**Code 10 (CM\_PROB\_FAILED\_START)**  
Indicates that the device did not start for some reason, but the I/O Manager attempted to start it with a set of resources. (Corresponds to DNF\_START\_FAILED.)

<span id="Code_12__CM_PROB_NORMAL_CONFLICT_"></span><span id="code_12__cm_prob_normal_conflict_"></span><span id="CODE_12__CM_PROB_NORMAL_CONFLICT_"></span>**Code 12 (CM\_PROB\_NORMAL\_CONFLICT)**  
Indicates that there were not sufficient resources to start this device. (Corresponds to DNF\_INSUFFICIENT\_RESOURCES.)

<span id="Code_14__CM_PROB_NEED_RESTART_"></span><span id="code_14__cm_prob_need_restart_"></span><span id="CODE_14__CM_PROB_NEED_RESTART_"></span>**Code 14 (CM\_PROB\_NEED\_RESTART)**  
Indicates that user mode reconfigured the device and a reboot is required for the changes to take effect. (Corresponds to DNF\_NEED\_RESTART.)

<span id="Code_18__CM_PROB_REINSTALL_"></span><span id="code_18__cm_prob_reinstall_"></span><span id="CODE_18__CM_PROB_REINSTALL_"></span>**Code 18 (CM\_PROB\_REINSTALL)**  
Indicates that the device needs to be installed and was installed previously. (Corresponds to DNF\_REINSTALL.)

<span id="Code_21__CM_PROB_WILL_BE_REMOVED_"></span><span id="code_21__cm_prob_will_be_removed_"></span><span id="CODE_21__CM_PROB_WILL_BE_REMOVED_"></span>**Code 21 (CM\_PROB\_WILL\_BE\_REMOVED)**  
Indicates that the user mode uninstalled this device. (Corresponds to DNF\_WILL\_BE\_REMOVED.)

<span id="Code_22__CM_PROB_DISABLED_"></span><span id="code_22__cm_prob_disabled_"></span><span id="CODE_22__CM_PROB_DISABLED_"></span>**Code 22 (CM\_PROB\_DISABLED)**  
Indicates that the device is disabled. (Corresponds to DNF\_DISABLED.)

<span id="Code_28__CM_PROB_FAILED_INSTALL_"></span><span id="code_28__cm_prob_failed_install_"></span><span id="CODE_28__CM_PROB_FAILED_INSTALL_"></span>**Code 28 (CM\_PROB\_FAILED\_INSTALL)**  
Indicates that the installation failed and there is no driver selected for this device, although the kernel did not report a problem (and there is no DNF\_XXX match for this the problem). This problem can be the result of an on-board system device (ISA timer, ISA RTC, RAM Memory, and so forth) that does not yet have an INF file.

<span id="Code_31__CM_PROB_FAILED_ADD_"></span><span id="code_31__cm_failed_add_"></span><span id="CODE_31__CM_FAILED_ADD_"></span>**Code 31 (CM_PROB_FAILED_ADD)**  
Indicates that the device was not added. Reasons for the failure may include: a driver's **AddDevice** routine returned an error or there is no service listed for the device in the registry. (Corresponds to DNF\_ADD\_FAILED.)
