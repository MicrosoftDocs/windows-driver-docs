<span id="free_build"></span><span id="FREE_BUILD"></span>**free build** 

Two different builds of each NT-based operating system exist:

-   The free build of Windows is the end-user version of the operating system. The system and drivers are built with full optimization, debugging asserts are disabled, and debugging information is stripped from the binaries. A free system and driver are smaller and faster, and it uses less memory.
-   The checked (or debug) build of Windows serves as a testing and debugging aid. For details, see checked build.

Distribution media containing the free build of the operating system do not have any special labels -- in other words, the CD containing the free build will just be labeled with the Windows version name, and no reference to the type of build.

<span id="first_chance_exception"></span><span id="FIRST_CHANCE_EXCEPTION"></span>**first-chance exception**  
The first opportunity to handle an exception. If an exception is not handled by any handler on the first opportunity, the handlers are given a second chance.
