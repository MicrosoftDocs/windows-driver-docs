# File | Source File Path


## <span id="ddk_file_source_file_path_dbg"></span><span id="DDK_FILE_SOURCE_FILE_PATH_DBG"></span>


Click **Source File Path** on the **File** menu to display, set, or append to the source path.

This command is equivalent to pressing CTRL+P.

### <span id="source_search_path_dialog_box"></span><span id="SOURCE_SEARCH_PATH_DIALOG_BOX"></span>Source Search Path Dialog Box

When you click **Source File Path**, the **Source Search Path** dialog box appears. This dialog box displays the current source path. If the **Source path** box is blank, there is no current source path.

You can enter a new path or edit the old path. If you want to search more than one directory, separate the directory names with semicolons.

If you are performing remote debugging, the **Local** check box will be available. Select this box to edit your debugging client's local source path; clear it to edit the debugging server's source path.

Click **OK** to save changes, or click **Cancel** to discard changes.

You can also click **Browse** to open the **Browse For Folder** dialog box.

### <span id="browse_for_folder_dialog_box"></span><span id="BROWSE_FOR_FOLDER_DIALOG_BOX"></span>Browse For Folder Dialog Box

In the **Browse For Folder** dialog box, you can browse through the folders on your computer or your network. You can also click the **Make New Folder** button to create a new folder. If you right-click a file or folder in this dialog box, a standard Windows shortcut menu appears.

Click **OK** to append the selected folder to the source path and return to the **Source Search Path** dialog box.
