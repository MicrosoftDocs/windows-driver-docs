For more information on locking memory, see [Locking Pageable Code or Data](../kernel/locking-pageable-code-or-data.md).

To research the cause of this bug check, use the [!lockedpages](../debuggercmds/-lockedpages.md) debugger extension to display all of the locked MDLs for the current process.

## Remarks

This bug check is issued only if the registry value  is equal to DWORD 1. 

**\\\\HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Session Manager\\Memory Management\\TrackLockedPages**

If this value is not set, the system will issue the less-informative [**bug check 0x76**](bug-check-0x76--process-has-locked-pages.md) (PROCESS\_HAS\_LOCKED\_PAGES).

This bug check can also be issued by Driver Verifier when the Pool Tracking option is enabled. For more information, see [Pool Tracking](../devtest/pool-tracking.md).
