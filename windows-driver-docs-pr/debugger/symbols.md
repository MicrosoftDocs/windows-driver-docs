# Symbols for Windows debugging (WinDbg, KD, CDB, NTSD)


Symbols for the Windows debuggers (WinDbg, KD, CDB, and NTSD) are available from a public symbol server. 

## <span id="symbols"></span><span id="SYMBOLS"></span>


This section includes:

[Introduction to Symbols](introduction-to-symbols.md)

[Accessing Symbols for Debugging](accessing-symbols-for-debugging.md)

[How the Debugger Recognizes Symbols](how-the-debugger-recognizes-symbols.md)

[Symbol Problems While Debugging](symbol-problems-while-debugging.md)

These topics explain what symbols are, how to access them during a debugging session, how to control the debugger's symbol options and symbol matching, and how to respond to various symbol-related problems during debugging.

If you simply want to configure your debugger to access symbols for your own programs and for Windows, you may find it quicker to read the less-detailed introductory topics [Symbol Path](symbol-path.md) and [Using a Symbol Server](using-a-symbol-server.md).
