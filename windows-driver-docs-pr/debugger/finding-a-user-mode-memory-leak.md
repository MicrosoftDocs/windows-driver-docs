# Finding a User-Mode Memory Leak

Use the following techniques to determine the cause of a user-mode memory leak:

- [Using Performance Monitor to Find a User-Mode Memory Leak](using-performance-monitor-to-find-a-user-mode-memory-leak.md)
- [Using UMDH to Find a User-Mode Memory Leak](using-umdh-to-find-a-user-mode-memory-leak.md)

The first technique determines which process is leaking memory. After you know which process is involved, the second technique can determine the specific routine that is at fault.
