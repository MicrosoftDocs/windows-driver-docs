## Cause

The pool is already corrupted at the time of the current request.

This may or may not be due to the caller.

## Resolution

The internal pool links must be walked using the kernel debugger to figure out a possible cause of the problem.

Then you can use special pool for the suspect pool tags, or use Driver Verifier "Special Pool" option on the suspect driver. The [**!analyze**](../debuggercmds/-analyze.md) extension may be of help in pinpointing the suspect driver, but this is frequently not the case with pool corrupters.

Use the steps described in [**Blue Screen Data**](blue-screen-data.md) to gather the Stop Code Parameters. Use the stop code parameters to determine the specific type of code behavior you are working to track down.

**Driver Verifier**

Driver Verifier is a tool that runs in real time to examine the behavior of drivers. If it see errors in the execution of driver code, it proactively creates an exception to allow that part of the driver code to be further scrutinized. The driver verifier manager is built into Windows and is available on all Windows PCs. To start the driver verifier manager, type *Verifier* at a command prompt. You can configure which drivers you would like to verify. The code that verifies drivers adds overhead as it runs, so try and verify the smallest number of drivers as possible. For more information, see [Driver Verifier](../devtest/driver-verifier.md).

**Windows Memory Diagnostics**

If this Bug Check appears inconsistently, it could be related to faulty physical memory.

Run the Windows Memory Diagnostics tool, to test the memory. In the control panel search box, type Memory, and then select **Diagnose your computer's memory problems**.â€Œ After the test is run, use Event viewer to view the results under the System log. Look for the *MemoryDiagnostics-Results* entry to view the results.
