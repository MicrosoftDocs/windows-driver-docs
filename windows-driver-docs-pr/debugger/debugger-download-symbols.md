# Windows symbol packages for debugging

Symbol files make it easier to debug your code. The easiest way to get Windows symbols is to use the [Microsoft public symbol server](microsoft-public-symbols.md). The symbol server makes symbols available to your debugging tools as needed. After a symbol file is downloaded from the symbol server, it's cached on the local computer for quick access.

## Symbol package deprecation

> [!IMPORTANT]
> We no longer publish the offline symbol packages for Windows.
>
> With the cadence that we release updates for Windows, the Windows debugging symbols we publish via the packages on this page are quickly made out of date.
> We've made significant improvements to the online *[Microsoft public symbol server](microsoft-public-symbols.md)* by transitioning this to an Azure-based symbol store. Symbols for all Windows versions and updates are available there.
> You can find more information in this *[blog entry](/archive/blogs/windbg/update-on-microsofts-symbol-server)*.
>
> For information on how to retrieve symbols for a machine that's not connected to the Internet, see *[Using a manifest file with SymChk](using-a-manifest-file-with-symchk.md)*.

## Symbol resources and feedback

To learn more about using symbols and debugging, see [Symbols and symbol files](symbols-and-symbol-files.md).

For help with debugging issues, see [Debugging resources](debugging-resources.md).

We're interested in your feedback about symbols. Mail suggestions or bug reports to [windbgfb@microsoft.com](mailto:windbgfb@microsoft.com). Technical support isn't available from this address, but your feedback will help us to plan future changes for symbols and will make them more useful to you in the future.
