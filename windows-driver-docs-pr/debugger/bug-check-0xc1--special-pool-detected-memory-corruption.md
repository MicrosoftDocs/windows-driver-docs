The \_POOL\_TYPE codes are enumerated in ntddk.h. In particular, zero indicates nonpaged pool and one indicates paged pool.

## Cause

A driver has written to an invalid section of the special pool.

## Resolution

Obtain a backtrace of the current thread. This backtrace will usually reveal the source of the error.

For information about the special pool, consult the Driver Verifier section of the Windows Driver Kit.
