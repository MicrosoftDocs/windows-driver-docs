If the driver responsible for the error can be identified, its name is printed on the blue screen and stored in memory at the location (PUNICODE\_STRING) **KiBugCheckDriver**.

## Cause

The driver is referencing session space addresses from the system process context. This probably results from the driver queuing an item to a system worker thread.

This driver needs to comply with Terminal Server's memory management rules.
