# Bug Check 0x9C: MACHINE\_CHECK\_EXCEPTION


The MACHINE\_CHECK\_EXCEPTION bug check has a value of 0x0000009C. This bug check indicates that a fatal machine check exception has occurred.

## MACHINE\_CHECK\_EXCEPTION Parameters


The four parameters that are listed in the message have different meanings, depending on the processor type.

If the processor is based on an older x86-based architecture and has the Machine Check Exception (MCE) feature but not the Machine Check Architecture (MCA) feature (for example, the Intel Pentium processor), the parameters have the following meaning.

<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th align="left">Parameter</th>
<th align="left">Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="left"><p>1</p></td>
<td align="left"><p>The low 32 bits of P5_MC_TYPE Machine Service Report (MSR)</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td align="left"><p>2</p></td>
<td align="left"><p>The address of the MCA_EXCEPTION structure</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="left"><p>3</p></td>

</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td align="left"><p>4</p></td>
<td align="left"><p>The low 32 bits of P5_MC_ADDR MSR</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

 

If the processor is based on a newer x86-based architecture and has the MCA feature and the MCE feature (for example, any Intel Processor of family 6 or higher, such as Pentium Pro, Pentium IV, or Xeon), or if the processor is an x64-based processor, the parameters have the following meaning.

## Remarks

This bug check occurs only in the following circumstances.

-   WHEA is not fully initialized.
-   All processors that rendezvous have no errors in their registers.

For other circumstances, this bug check has been replaced with [**bug Check 0x124: WHEA\_UNCORRECTABLE\_ERROR**](bug-check-0x124---whea-uncorrectable-error.md) in Windows Vista and later operating systems.

For more information about Machine Check Architecture (MCA), see the Intel or AMD Web sites.
