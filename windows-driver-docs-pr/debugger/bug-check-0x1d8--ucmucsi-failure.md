## UCMUCSI\_FAILURE Parameters

|Parameter|Description|
|-------- |---------- |
|1| Type of failure. VALUES: **0x0** : A UCSI command has timed out because the firmware did not respond to the command in time. **0x1** : A UCSI command execution failed either because the client driver returned failure or because the firmware returned an error code. |
|2| The UCSI command value. |
|3| If non-zero, the pointer to additional information (use `dt UcmUcsiCx!UCMUCSICX_TRIAGE`). |
|4| Reserved. |

## Cause

The UcmUcsi driver has encountered an error. The driver has found settings to trigger a system crash instead of a livedump.

## Resolution
-----

A UCSI Command typically fails when UCSI firmware is not responsive and UcmUcsiCx times out on a UCSI command or the UCSI firmware has indicated an error in response to a critical UCSI command sent by UcmUcsiCx.

Run `!rcdrkd.rcdrlogdump UcmUcsiCx` for more information on the cause of this failure.
