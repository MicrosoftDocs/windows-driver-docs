# Messages from the Target


## <span id="ddk_messages_from_the_target_dbg"></span><span id="DDK_MESSAGES_FROM_THE_TARGET_DBG"></span>


A target application or target computer can send messages to the debugger or break into the debugger, either conditionally or unconditionally, by using a variety of routines. A kernel-mode target can also test whether a debugger is currently attached.

This section includes:

-   [Breaking Into the Debugger](breaking-into-the-debugger.md)

-   [Sending Output to the Debugger](sending-output-to-the-debugger.md)

-   [Reading and Filtering Debugging Messages](reading-and-filtering-debugging-messages.md)

-   [Determining if a Debugger is Attached](determining-if-a-debugger-is-attached.md)
