# Edit | Evaluate Selection


## <span id="ddk_edit_evaluate_selection_dbg"></span><span id="DDK_EDIT_EVALUATE_SELECTION_DBG"></span>


Click **Evaluate Selection** on the **Edit** menu to evaluate the current selection in the [Source window](source-window.md) and display the result in the [Debugger Command window](debugger-command-window.md).

This command is equivalent to pressing CTRL+SHIFT+V, clicking **Evaluate selection** on the Source window's shortcut menu, or using the [**?? (Evaluate C++ Expression)**](----evaluate-c---expression-.md) command together with the selected text as its argument.

If the selected text includes more than one line, a syntax error results. If no text is selected in a Source window, you cannot use this command.
