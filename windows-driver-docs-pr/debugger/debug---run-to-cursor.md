# Debug | Run to Cursor


## <span id="ddk_debug_run_to_cursor_dbg"></span><span id="DDK_DEBUG_RUN_TO_CURSOR_DBG"></span>


Click **Run to Cursor** on the **Debug** menu to resume running on the target. If you insert the cursor on an instruction in the [Disassembly window](disassembly-window.md) or a [Source window](source-window.md) and then execute this action, WinDbg executes all instructions from the current instruction up to the instruction you have selected.

This command is equivalent to pressing F7 or CTRL+F10 or clicking the **Run to cursor (Ctrl+F10 or F7)** button (![screen shot of the run to cursor button](images/tbcursor.png)) on the toolbar.
