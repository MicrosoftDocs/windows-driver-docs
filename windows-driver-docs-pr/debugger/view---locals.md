Click **Locals** on the **View** menu to open the Locals window. If this window is already open, it becomes active.

This command is equivalent to pressing ALT+3 or clicking the **Locals (Alt+3)** button (![screen shot of the locals button](images/tblocal.png)) on the toolbar.

For more information about this window and its uses, see [Locals Window](locals-window.md).
