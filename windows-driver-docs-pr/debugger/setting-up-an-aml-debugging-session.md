# Setting Up an AML Debugging Session


## <span id="ddk_setting_up_an_aml_debugging_session_dbg"></span><span id="DDK_SETTING_UP_AN_AML_DEBUGGING_SESSION_DBG"></span>


The AMLI Debugger code is contained in Acpi.sys. In order to fully perform AML debugging, this driver must be installed on your target computer, which it normally is.

To activate breaking into debugger on free builds, use the **!amli set dbgbrkon** command, that is part of the AMLI Debugger extensions. For more information, see [**!amli set**](../debuggercmds/-amli-set.md).
