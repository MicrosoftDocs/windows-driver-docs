# Bug Check 0xD0: DRIVER\_CORRUPTED\_MMPOOL


The DRIVER\_CORRUPTED\_MMPOOL bug check has a value of 0x000000D0. This indicates that the system attempted to access invalid memory at a process IRQL that was too high.

## Cause

The kernel attempted to access pageable memory (or perhaps completely invalid memory) when the IRQL was too high. The ultimate cause of this problem is almost certainly a driver that has corrupted the system pool.

In most cases, this bug check results if a driver corrupts a large allocation (PAGE\_SIZE or larger). Smaller allocations result in [**bug check 0xC5**](bug-check-0xc5--driver-corrupted-expool.md) (DRIVER\_CORRUPTED\_EXPOOL).

## Resolution

If you have recently installed any new software, check to see if it is properly installed. Check for updated drivers on the manufacturer's website.

To debug this error, use the special pool option of Driver Verifier. If this fails to reveal the driver that caused the error, use the Global Flags utility to enable the special pool by pool tag.

For information about the special pool, consult the Driver Verifier section of the Windows Driver Kit.

An alternate method is to open the **\\\\HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Session Manager\\Memory Management** registry key. In this key, create or edit the **ProtectNonPagedPool** value, and set it equal to DWORD 1. Then reboot. Then the system will unmap all freed nonpaged pool. This will prevent drivers from corrupting the pool. (This does not protect the pool from DMA hardware, however.)
