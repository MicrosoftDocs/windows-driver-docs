# Setting Up Local Kernel Debugging of a Single Computer Manually


Debugging Tools for Windows supports *local kernel debugging*. This is kernel-mode debugging on a single computer. In other words, the debugger runs on the same computer that is being debugged. With local debugging, you can examine state, but not break into kernel mode processes that would cause the OS to stop running.

The *local* bcdedit option is available in Windows 8.0 and Windows Server 2012 and later.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Before using bcdedit to change boot information you may need to temporarily suspend Windows security features such as BitLocker and Secure Boot on the test PC. 
> You can re-enable Secure Boot once you’re done debugging and you’ve disabled kernel debugging on the local computer.  


1.  Open a Command Prompt window as Administrator. Enter **bcdedit /debug on**
2.  If the computer is not already configured as the target of a debug transport, enter **bcdedit /dbgsettings local**
3.  Reboot the computer.
