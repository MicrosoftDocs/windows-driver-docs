## Cause

This condition is usually caused by a driver failing to cancel a timer or DPC before freeing the memory where it resides.

## Resolution

If you are the driver writer, use the information obtained through this bug check to fix the bugs in your code.

If you are a system administrator, you should unload the driver if the problem persists.
