# Configuring Special Pool


## <span id="ddk_configuring_kernel_special_pool_dtools"></span><span id="DDK_CONFIGURING_KERNEL_SPECIAL_POOL_DTOOLS"></span>


The Gflags *Special Pool* feature directs Windows to request memory allocations from a reserved memory pool when the memory is allocated with a specified pool tag or is within a specified size range.

For detailed information about this feature, see [Special Pool](special-pool.md).

In Windows Vista and later versions of Windows, you can configure the Special Pool feature as a system-wide registry setting or as a kernel flags setting that does not require a reboot. In earlier versions of Windows, Special Pool is available only as a registry setting.

In Windows Vista and later versions of Windows, you can also use the command line to request special pool by pool tag. For information, see [**GFlags Commands**](gflags-commands.md).

This section includes the following topics.

**Note**   Use *Driver Verifier* to request special pool for allocations by a particular driver. For more information, see the "Special Pool" topic in the "Driver Verifier" section of the Windows Driver Kit (WDK).
