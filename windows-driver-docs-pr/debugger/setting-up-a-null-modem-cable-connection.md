# Setting Up Kernel-Mode Debugging over a Serial Cable Manually

Debugging Tools for Windows supports kernel debugging over a null-modem cable. Null-modem cables are serial cables that have been configured to send data between two serial ports. Do not confuse null-modem cables with standard serial cables. Standard serial cables do not connect serial ports to each other. For information about how null-modem cables are wired, see [Null-Modem Cable Wiring](#null-modem-cable-wiring).

The computer that runs the debugger is called the *host computer*, and the computer being debugged is called the *target computer*.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Before using bcdedit to change boot information you may need to temporarily suspend Windows security features such as BitLocker and Secure Boot on the test PC.
> You can re-enable Secure Boot once you’re done debugging and you’ve disabled kernel debugging.  

1. On the target computer, open a Command Prompt window as Administrator, and enter the following commands, where *n* is the number of the COM port used for debugging on the target computer, and *rate* is the baud rate used for debugging:

   **bcdedit /debug on**

   **bcdedit /dbgsettings serial debugport:**<em>n</em> **baudrate:**<em>rate</em>

   **Note**  The baud rate must be the same on the host computer and the target computer. The recommended rate is 115200.

2. Reboot the target computer.

Connect the null-modem cable to the COM ports that you have chosen for debugging on the host and target computers.

### <span id="Using_WinDbg"></span><span id="using_windbg"></span><span id="USING_WINDBG"></span>Using WinDbg

On the host computer, open WinDbg. On the **File** menu, choose **Kernel Debug**. In the Kernel Debugging dialog box, open the **COM** tab. In the **Baud rate** box, enter the rate you have chosen for debugging. In the **Port** box, enter COM*n* where *n* is the COM port number you have chosen for debugging on the host computer. Select **OK**.

You can also start a session with WinDbg by entering the following command in a Command Prompt window; *n* is the number of the COM port used for debugging on the host computer, and *rate* is the baud rate used for debugging:

**windbg -k com:port=COM**<em>n</em>**,baud=**<em>rate</em>

### <span id="Using_KD"></span><span id="using_kd"></span><span id="USING_KD"></span>Using KD

On the host computer, open a Command Prompt window, and enter the following command, where *n* is the number of the COM port used for debugging on the host computer, and *rate* is the baud rate used for debugging:

**kd -k com:port=COM**<em>n</em>**,baud=**<em>rate</em>

## <span id="Using_Environment_Variables"></span><span id="using_environment_variables"></span><span id="USING_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES"></span>Using Environment Variables


On the host computer, you can use environment variables to specify the COM port and the baud rate. Then you do not have to specify the port and baud rate each time you start a debugging session. To use environment variables to specify the COM port and baud rate, open a Command Prompt window and enter the following commands, where *n* is the number of the COM port used for debugging on the host computer, and *rate* is the baud rate used for debugging:

- **set \_NT\_DEBUG\_PORT=COM***n*
- **set \_NT\_DEBUG\_BAUD\_RATE=**<em>rate</em>

To start a debugging session, open a Command Prompt window, and enter one of the following commands:

-   **kd**
-   **windbg**

### <span id="Specify_correct_COM_port_on_both_host_and_target"></span><span id="specify_correct_com_port_on_both_host_and_target"></span><span id="SPECIFY_CORRECT_COM_PORT_ON_BOTH_HOST_AND_TARGET"></span>Specify correct COM port on both host and target

Determine the number of COM ports you are using for debugging on the host and target computers. For example, suppose you have your null-modem cable connected to COM1 on the host computer and COM2 on the target computer.

On the target computer, open a Command Prompt window as Administrator, and enter **bcdedit /dbgsettings**. If you are using COM2 on the target computer, the output of **bcdedit** should show `debugport 2`.

On the host computer, specify the correct COM port when you start the debugger or when you set environment variables. If you are using COM1 on the host computer, use one of the following methods to specify the COM port.

-   In WinDbg, in the Kernel Debugging dialog box, enter COM1 in the **Port** box.
-   **windbg -k com:port=COM1, ...**
-   **kd -k com:port=COM1, ...**
-   **set \_NT\_DEBUG\_PORT=COM1**

### <span id="Baud_rate_must_be_the_same_on_host_and_target"></span><span id="baud_rate_must_be_the_same_on_host_and_target"></span><span id="BAUD_RATE_MUST_BE_THE_SAME_ON_HOST_AND_TARGET"></span>Baud rate must be the same on host and target

The baud rate used for debugging over a serial cable must be set to the same value on the host and target computers. For example, suppose you have chosen a baud rate of 115200.

On the target computer, open a Command Prompt window as Administrator, and enter **bcdedit /dbgsettings**. The output of **bcdedit** should show `baudrate 115200`.

On the host computer, specify the correct baud rate when you start the debugger or when you set environment variables. Use one of the following methods to specify a baud rate of 115200.

-   In WinDbg, in the Kernel Debugging dialog box, enter 115200 in the **Baud rate** box.
-   **windbg -k ..., baud=115200**
-   **kd -k ..., baud=115200**
-   **set \_NT\_DEBUG\_BAUD\_RATE=115200**
