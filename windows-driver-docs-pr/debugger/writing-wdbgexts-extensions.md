WdbgExts extensions are the original kind of debugger extensions. They are less powerful than DbgEng extensions, but they still offer a wide range of functionality when performing user-mode or kernel-mode debugging on Microsoft Windows.

If you performed a full install of Debugging Tools for Windows, a sample WdbgExts extension called "simplext" can be found in the sdk\\samples\\simplext subdirectory of the installation directory.
