## Cause

One possible cause of this bug check is disk corruption. Corruption in the third-party file system or bad blocks (sectors) on the hard disk can induce this error. Corrupted SCSI and IDE drivers can also adversely affect the Windows operating system's ability to read and write to disk, thus causing the error.

Another possible cause is depletion of nonpaged pool memory. If the nonpaged pool is completely depleted, this error can stop the system.

## Resolution

**To debug this problem:** Use the [**.cxr (Display Context Record)**](../debuggercmds/-cxr--display-context-record-.md) command with Parameter 3, and then use [**kb (Display Stack Backtrace)**](../debuggercmds/k--kb--kc--kd--kp--kp--kv--display-stack-backtrace-.md).

**To resolve a disk corruption problem:** Check Event Viewer for error messages from SCSI, IDE, or other disk controllers in the system that might help pinpoint the device or driver that is causing the error. Try disabling any virus scanners, backup programs, or disk defragmenter tools that continually monitor the system. You should also run hardware diagnostics supplied by the file system or the file system filter manufacturer.

**To resolve a nonpaged pool memory depletion problem:** Add new physical memory to the computer. This will increase the quantity of nonpaged pool memory available to the kernel.
