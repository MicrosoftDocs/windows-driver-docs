## Cause

The worker routine returned while it still owned a mutex object. The current worker thread will proceed to run other unrelated work items, and the mutex will never be released.

## Resolution

A debugger is required to analyze this problem. To find the driver that caused the error, use the **ln** (List Nearest Symbols) debugger command:

kd&gt; ln address

Where address is the worker routine given in Parameter 1.
