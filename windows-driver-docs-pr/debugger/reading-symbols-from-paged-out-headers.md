# Reading Symbols from Paged-Out Headers

The kernel debugger must read the header for each loaded module's image in order to know which symbols correspond to that module.

If a module's header is paged out to disk, the debugger will not load symbols for this module. If this happens with a module that is essential to the debugging process, it can be a critical problem.

The following procedure can be used to solve this problem.

## To acquire symbols for paged-out headers

1. Make a second copy of the kernel itself. It is probably easiest to put this on a network share.

2. Append the root directory of this share to the symbol path. See [Symbol Path](symbol-path.md) for the ways to change the symbol path.

3. Use the [**.reload (Reload Module)**](../debuggercmds/-reload--reload-module-.md) command.

4. Use the [**!sym noisy**](../debuggercmds/-sym.md) extension command to see more verbose output. If this is used, you will be able to see which symbols are loaded from the module images on the target computer, and which are loaded from the copy of the kernel modules.

This technique must be used with care, since the debugger has no way of verifying whether the file copies actually match the originals. So it is crucial that the version of Windows used on the network share matches the version used on the target computer.

This technique is only used for kernel-mode debugging. The operating system is capable of paging in any headers required during user-mode debugging (unless the disk holding the paging file is dismounted or otherwise inaccessible).

Here is an example of this technique being used:

```dbgcmd
kd> .reload

.......
Loading unloaded module list
..............
Loading User Symbols

```

Notice that many images have inaccessible headers. Check the symbols from one of these files (in this example, fs\_rec.sys):

```dbgcmd
kd> x fs_rec!*
*** ERROR: Module load completed but symbols could not be loaded for fs_rec.sys
```

These headers are apparently paged out. So you need to add the proper images to the symbol path:

```dbgcmd
kd> .sympath+ \\myserver\myshare\symbols\x86fre\symbols
Symbol search path is: symsrv*symsrv.dll*c:\localcache*https://msdl.microsoft.com/download/symbols;\\myserver\myshare\symbols\x86fre\symbols

kd> .reload

The same warnings have appeared, but the symbols themselves are now accessible:

```dbgcmd

```
