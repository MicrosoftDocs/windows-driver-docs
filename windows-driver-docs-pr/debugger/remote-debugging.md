# Remote Debugging


## <span id="ddk_remote_debugging_dbg"></span><span id="DDK_REMOTE_DEBUGGING_DBG"></span>


Remote user-mode debugging involves two computers: the *client* and the *server*. The server is the computer that runs the application to be debugged. The server also runs the user-mode debugger or a process server. The client is the computer that remotely controls the debugging session.

Remote kernel-mode debugging involves three computers: the *client*, the *server*, and the *target computer*. The target computer is the computer to be debugged. The server is a computer that runs the kernel debugger or a KD connection server. The client is the computer that remotely controls the debugging session.
