# Remote Tool Commands


## <span id="ddk_remote_tool_commands_dtools"></span><span id="DDK_REMOTE_TOOL_COMMANDS_DTOOLS"></span>


The Remote tool has a separate command syntax for the client and server sides of a session. Commands to start a server session must be entered first because they establish the communications pipe to which the client connects.

The Remote tool also has a query command and a separate set of commands that you use to communicate with the Remote tool (instead of the console program) during a remote session.

These commands are described in the following topics:

[**Remote Server Syntax**](remote-server-syntax.md)

[**Remote Client Syntax**](remote-client-syntax.md)

[**Remote Server Query Command**](remote-server-query-command.md)

[Remote Session Commands](remote-session-commands.md)
