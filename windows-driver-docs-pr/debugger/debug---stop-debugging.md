Click **Stop Debugging** on the **Debug** menu to stop the target's execution and end the target process and all its threads. This action enables you to start to debug a different target application.

This command is equivalent to pressing SHIFT+F5 or clicking the **Stop debugging (Shift+F5)** button (![screen shot of the stop debugging button](images/tbstop.png)) on the toolbar.
