|0xC5 |Address of the driver dispatch routine|The current thread's APC disable count|The thread's APC disable count prior to calling the driver dispatch routine|A driver dispatch routine has changed the thread's APC disable count. The APC disable count is decremented each time a driver calls [KeEnterCriticalRegion](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ntddk/nf-ntddk-keentercriticalregion), [FsRtlEnterFileSystem](../ifs/fsrtlenterfilesystem.md), or acquires a mutex.

In this case, the address of the IO_REMOVE_LOCK structure used by the driver is not used at all, because Driver Verifier is replacing the lock address for all the remove lock APIs. A bug check with this parameter occurs only when the I/O Verification option of Driver Verifier is active.|

If the driver calling [IoReleaseRemoveLock](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-ioreleaseremovelock) is not a checked build, Parameter 2 is the address of the shadow IO_REMOVE_LOCK structure created by Driver Verifier on behalf of the driver. In this case, the address of the IO_REMOVE_LOCK structure used by the driver is not used at all, because Driver Verifier is replacing the lock address for all the remove lock APIs.

## Cause

See the description of each code in the Parameters section for a description of the cause. Further information can be obtained by using the [**!analyze -v**](../debuggercmds/-analyze.md) extension.

## Resolution

This bug check can only occur when Driver Verifier has been instructed to monitor one or more drivers. If you did not intend to use Driver Verifier, you should deactivate it. You might also consider removing the driver that caused this problem.

If you are the driver writer, use the information obtained through this bug check to fix the bugs in your code.

For full details on Driver Verifier, see [Driver Verifier](../devtest/driver-verifier.md).

## Remarks

The \_POOL\_TYPE codes are enumerated in Ntddk.h. In particular, **0** (zero) indicates nonpaged pool and **1** (one) indicates paged pool.

*(Windows 8 and later versions of Windows)* If [DDI compliance checking](../devtest/ddi-compliance-checking.md) causes a bug check, run [Static Driver Verifier](../devtest/static-driver-verifier.md) on the driver source code and specify the DDI compliance rule (identified by the parameter 1 value) that caused the bug check. Static Driver Verifier can help you locate the cause of the problem in your source code.
