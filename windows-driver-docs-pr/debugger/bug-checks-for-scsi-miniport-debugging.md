# Bug Checks for SCSI Miniport Debugging


There are primarily two bug checks that arise in the course of debugging a SCSI miniport driver: bug check 0x77 (KERNEL\_STACK\_INPAGE\_ERROR) and bug check 0x7A (KERNEL\_DATA\_INPAGE\_ERROR). For full details of their parameters, see [**Bug Check 0x77**](bug-check-0x77--kernel-stack-inpage-error.md) and [**Bug Check 0x7A**](bug-check-0x7a--kernel-data-inpage-error.md).

Each of these bug checks indicates that a paging error has occurred. There are three main causes for these bug checks:

-   Full bus reset due to a timeout on a particular device or no activity on an adapter

-   Selection time-out

-   Controller errors

To determine the precise cause of the failure, begin by using the [**!scsikd.classext**](../debuggercmds/-scsikd-classext.md) extension, which displays information about recently failed requests, including the SRB status, SCSI status, and sense data of the request.

```dbgcmd
kd> !scsikd.classext 816e96b0
Storage class device 816e96b0 with extension at 816e9768

    Failed requests:

```

In the previous example, opcode 0x2A indicates a write operation, and 0x28 indicates a read operation. The SCSI status in the example is 02, which indicates a check condition. The sense codes provide more error information.

As always, miniport driver developers are responsible for associating error codes from their hardware to the SRB status codes. Typically, timeouts are associated with SRB 0x0A, the code for a selection timeout. SRB 0x0e is typically associated with a full bus reset, but it can also be associated with controller errors.
