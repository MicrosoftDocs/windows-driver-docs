Click **Font** on the **View** menu to change the font that appears in the debugging information windows.

This command is equivalent to clicking the **Font** button (![screen shot of the font button](images/tbfont.png)) on the toolbar.

When you click **Font**, the **Font** dialog box appears. In this dialog box, you can select the font, style, and size from the appropriate lists,. You can also select the script from a drop-down menu to get the appropriate alphabet. To accept your changes, click **OK**.

Click **Cancel** to cancel changes to the font.
