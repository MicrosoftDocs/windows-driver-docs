The handling status specifies whether the debugger engine should flag an exception event as handled or not. The handling status is part of an exception filter.

See also break status. For more information, see [Controlling Exceptions and Events](controlling-exceptions-and-events.md) and [Event Filters](event-filters.md)

<span id="host_computer"></span><span id="HOST_COMPUTER"></span>**host computer**  
The host computer is the computer that runs the debugging session. All debugger operations--such as executing commands and extensions, and symbol loading--are performed on the host computer.

In a typical two-system kernel debugging session, the debugger is running on the host computer, which is connected to the target computer being debugged.
