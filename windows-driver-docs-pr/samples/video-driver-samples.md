# Video driver samples

The driver samples in this directory provide a starting point for writing a custom video driver for your device.

| Sample | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Kernel mode display-only miniport driver (KMDOD) sample](/samples/microsoft/windows-driver-samples/kernel-mode-display-only-miniport-driver-kmdod-sample)  | Implements most device driver interfaces (DDIs) that a display-only miniport driver should provide to the Windows Display Driver Model (WDDM). The code is useful to understand how to write a miniport driver for a display-only device, or how to develop a full WDDM driver. |
| [PixLib](/samples/microsoft/windows-driver-samples/pixlib-sample) | Demonstrates how to implement the CPixel class for use by a display driver. |
