# Windows driver samples

You can browse and download individual Windows 10 driver samples on the [Microsoft Samples portal](/samples/browse/?products=windows-wdk). You can also clone, fork, or download the [Windows-driver-samples](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-driver-samples) repo on GitHub.

Earlier versions of Windows driver samples are archived at Microsoft Archive on GitHub:

- [Windows 8.1 driver samples](https://github.com/microsoftarchive/msdn-code-gallery-microsoft/tree/master/Official%20Windows%20Driver%20Kit%20Sample/Windows%20Driver%20Kit%20(WDK)%208.1%20Samples)

- [Windows 8 driver samples](https://github.com/microsoftarchive/msdn-code-gallery-microsoft/tree/master/Official%20Windows%20Driver%20Kit%20Sample/Windows%20Driver%20Kit%20(WDK)%208.0%20Samples)

For Windows 7, samples were included in the Windows Driver Kit (WDK).
