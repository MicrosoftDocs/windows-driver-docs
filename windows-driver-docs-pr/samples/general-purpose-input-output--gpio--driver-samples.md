# General-purpose input/output (GPIO) driver samples

The driver samples in this directory provide a starting point for writing a custom GPIOdriver for your device.

| Sample | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [GPIO Drivers](/samples/microsoft/windows-driver-samples/gpio-sample-drivers) | The GPIO driver samples contain annotated code to illustrate how to write a GPIO controller driver that works in conjunction with the GPIO framework extension (GpioClx) to handle GPIO I/O control requests, and a peripheral driver that runs in kernel mode and uses GPIO resources. |
