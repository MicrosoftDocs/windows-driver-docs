# AVStream driver samples

The AVStream driver samples in this directory provide a starting point for writing a custom streaming media driver for your device.

| Sample | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [AvsCamera - AVStream camera sample driver](/samples/microsoft/windows-driver-samples/avscamera) | Provides a pin-centric AVStream capture driver for a simulated front and back camera that performs simulated captures at 320x240 or 640x480 in RGB24, RGB32, YUY2 and NV12 formats at various frame rates. |
| [AVStream simulated hardware sample driver (Avshws)](/samples/microsoft/windows-driver-samples/avstream-simulated-hardware-sample-driver-avshws) | A simulated hardware sample driver providing a pin-centric capture driver to simulate AV capture hardware. |
| [AVStream filter-centric simulated capture sample driver (Avssamp)](/samples/microsoft/windows-driver-samples/avstream-filter-centric-simulated-capture-sample-driver-avssamp/) | The AVStream filter-centric simulated capture sample driver with functional audio. |
| [Driver Device Transform Sample](/samples/microsoft/windows-driver-samples/driver-device-transform-sample) | Illustrative example for a Driver Device Transform which loads in a process streaming an Avstream-based camera device using Media Foundation. |
| [Driver MFT Sample](/samples/microsoft/windows-driver-samples/driver-mft-sample) | A driver MFT for use with a camera's UWP device app. A driver MFT is a Media Foundation Transform that is used with a specific camera when capturing video. |
