# Print driver samples

The driver samples in this directory provide a starting point for writing a custom print driver for your device.

| Sample | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Print Auto Configuration](/samples/microsoft/windows-driver-samples/print-auto-configuration-sample) | Demonstrates how to implement Unidrv-based and PScript5-based drivers to leverage the inbox support for auto-configuration. The sample works only when used with the standard TCP/IP port monitor or the Network-Connected Device (NCD) port monitor. |
| [Common Property Sheet UI](/samples/microsoft/windows-driver-samples/common-property-sheet-ui-sample) | An application that causes the Common Property Sheet User Interface (CPSUI) to call the Windows print spooler to create property sheet pages for the system's default printer. |
| [OEM Printer Customization Plug-in Samples](/samples/microsoft/windows-driver-samples/oem-printer-customization-plug-in-samples) | The OEMDLL samples are an illustration of OEM customization plug-ins. The BITMAP, OEMPS, OEMUI, OEMUNI, OEMPREAN, CUSTHLP, SyncSet, ThemeUI, PSUIRep, and Watermark samples do not affect the printer output. They are only examples of how to build OEM Customization DLLs of various types.|
| [OpenXPS Documents](/samples/microsoft/windows-driver-samples/openxps-documents-print-sample) | Contains a set of documents that were generated from a variety of sources, including those generated from the Windows Presentation Foundation in the .NET Framework and from the Microsoft XPS Document Writer (MXDW). They have been included to provide you with a few documents that exercise a variety of features of the XML Paper Specification. |
| [XPS Documents](/samples/microsoft/windows-driver-samples/xps-documents-print-sample) | Contains a set of documents that were generated from a variety of sources, including those generated from the Windows Presentation Foundation in the .NET Framework and from the Microsoft XPS Document Writer (MXDW). They have been included to provide you with a few documents that exercise a variety of features of the XML Paper Specification. |
| [Print Pipeline Simple Filter](/samples/microsoft/windows-driver-samples/print-pipeline-simple-filter) | Shows how to use the print pipeline's filter interfaces. |
| [Printer Extension](/samples/microsoft/windows-driver-samples/printer-extension-sample) | Demonstrates how to use .NET to build a customized, desktop UI for a v4 print driver. This .NET application uses PrintTicket, PrintCapabilities and Bidi in order to communicate with the print system and is suitable for inclusion in a v4 print driver. |
| [Print Driver Constraints](/samples/microsoft/windows-driver-samples/print-driver-constraints-sample) | Demonstrates how to implement advanced constraint handling, and also PrintTicket/PrintCapabilities handling using JavaScript.  |
| [USB Host-Based Print Driver](/samples/microsoft/windows-driver-samples/usb-host-based-print-driver-sample) | Demonstrates how to support host-based devices that use the v4 print driver model, and are connected via USB. |
| [Print USB Monitor and BiDi](/samples/microsoft/windows-driver-samples/print-driver-usb-monitor-and-bidi-sample)  | Demonstrates how to support bidirectional (Bidi) communication over the USB bus, using JavaScript and XML. This sample supports bidirectional status while not printing, and unsolicited status from the printer while printing. |
| [WSDMon Bidi Extension](/samples/microsoft/windows-driver-samples/wsdmon-bidi-extension-sample)  | Demonstrates how to use an XML extension file to support bidirectional (Bidi) communication with a WSD connected printer. |
| [XPSDrv Driver and Filter](/samples/microsoft/windows-driver-samples/xpsdrv-driver-and-filter-sample) | This sample is intended to provide a starting point for developing XPSDrv printer drivers and to illustrate the facility and potential of an XPSDrv print driver. This goal is accomplished by implementing a number of real-world features within a set of XPS print pipeline filters that are configured through a configuration plug-in that supports custom UI content and PrintTicket handling. |
| [XPS Rasterization Filter Service](/samples/microsoft/windows-driver-samples/xps-rasterization-filter-service-sample) | An XPSDrv filter that rasterizes fixed pages in an XPS document. Hardware vendors can modify this sample to build an XPSDrv filter that produces bitmap images for their printers or other display devices. |
