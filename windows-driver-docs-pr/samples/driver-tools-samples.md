# Tools samples

The driver samples in this directory contains intentional code errors that are designed to show the capabilities and features of Static Driver Verifier (SDV).

SDV is a static verification tool that systematically analyzes the source code of Windows kernel-mode drivers. SDV is included in the Windows Driver Kit (WDK) and can be run from Microsoft Visual Studio.

| Sample | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [DV-FailDriver-WDM](/samples/microsoft/windows-driver-samples/dv-faildriver-wdm/) | This sample demonstrates how DV can find errors in a WDM driver. |
| [SDV-FailDriver-KMDF](/samples/microsoft/windows-driver-samples/sdv-faildriver-kmdf/) | This sample demonstrates how SDV can find errors in a KMDF driver. |
| [SDV-FailDriver-NDIS](/samples/microsoft/windows-driver-samples/sdv-faildriver-ndis/) | This sample demonstrates how SDV can find errors in a NDIS driver. |
| [SDV-FailDriver-STORPORT](/samples/microsoft/windows-driver-samples/sdv-faildriver-storport/) | This sample demonstrates how SDV can find errors in a Storport driver. |
| [SDV-FailDriver-WDM](/samples/microsoft/windows-driver-samples/sdv-faildriver-wdm/) | This sample demonstrates how SDV can find errors in a WDM driver. |
