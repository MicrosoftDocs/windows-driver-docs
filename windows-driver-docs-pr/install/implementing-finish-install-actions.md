# Implementing Finish-Install Actions

> [!NOTE]
> Features described in this section are not supported in universal or mobile driver packages. See [Using a Universal INF File](using-a-universal-inf-file.md).

*Installers* (a class installer, class co-installer, or device co-installer) supply finish-install actions. A finish-install action can run an executable program, create a process, create a thread, or execute code in the device driver installation finish-install process.

To implement finish-install actions, an installer:

1.  Sets the DI_FLAGSEX_FINISHINSTALL_ACTION flag when the installer processes a [**DIF_NEWDEVICEWIZARD_FINISHINSTALL**](./dif-newdevicewizard-finishinstall.md) DIF code and returns one of the following error codes:
    -   ERROR_DI_DO_DEFAULT if it is a class installer without finish-install wizard pages.
    -   NO_ERROR if it is a class installer with finish-install wizard pages or a co-installer with or without finish-install wizard pages.

2.  Performs the finish-install actions when it processes a [**DIF_FINISHINSTALL_ACTION**](./dif-finishinstall-action.md) request.

    An installer returns one of the error codes in the following table.

    <table>
    <colgroup>
    <col width="50%" />
    <col width="50%" />
    </colgroup>
    <thead>
    <tr class="header">
    <th align="left">Error code</th>
    <th align="left">Meaning</th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr class="odd">
    <td align="left"><p>ERROR_DI_DO_DEFAULT</p></td>
    <td align="left"><p>Class installer: The class installer has successfully run its finish-install actions and is requesting Windows to perform its default processing. A class installer should also return this error code if it has no finish-install actions.</p>
    <p>Device or class co-installer: Co-installers do not return this error code.</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="even">
    <td align="left"><p>NO_ERROR</p></td>
    <td align="left"><p>Class installer: The class installer has successfully run its finish-install action. Windows should not perform its default processing.</p>
    <p>Device or class co-installer: The co-installer has either successfully run its finish-install actions or has no finish-install actions.</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="odd">
    <td align="left"><p>Microsoft Win32 error</p></td>
    <td align="left"><p>The installer encountered an error, but the finish-install action should be attempted again. Returning a Win32 error code indicates that Windows should run another finish-install process to complete the finish-install actions the next time the device is enumerated.</p></td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>




**Note**   If a finish-install action fails and should not be attempted again, a class installer returns ERROR_DI_DO_DEFAULT and a device or class co-installer returns NO_ERROR.
