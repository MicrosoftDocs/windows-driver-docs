# Accessing Device Setup Class Properties


In Windows Vista and later versions of Windows, the [unified device property model](unified-device-property-model--windows-vista-and-later-.md) includes the following:

-   [Device setup class properties](/previous-versions/ff542239(v=vs.85)) that correspond to the SPCRP_*Xxx* identifiers that are defined in *Setupapi.h.*

-   Properties that do not have SPCRP_*Xxx* identifiers, but do have corresponding system-defined registry entry values.
