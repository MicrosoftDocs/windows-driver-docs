# Cross-Platform INF Files


The simplest strategy for cross-platform INF files is to create a separate INF file for each platform type because this approach is the easiest to create and maintain. For more information about how to create platform-specific INF files, see [Creating INF Files for Multiple Platforms and Operating Systems](creating-inf-files-for-multiple-platforms-and-operating-systems.md).

You can create a single cross-operating system and cross-platform INF file for a device if the device does not have operating system-specific installation requirements. For example, if the files or registry settings that support a device differ between operating system versions for a given platform, you cannot, in general, create a single INF file for that platform type that is supported by all operating system versions.

To create a single cross-operating system and cross-platform INF file for Windows 2000 and later versions of Windows, the simplest approach is as follows:

-   Use **.ntia64** platform extensions on the names of sections that are required to install components on Itanium-based systems, and use **.ntamd64** platform extensions on the names of sections that are required to install components on x64-based systems.

-   Because **.nt** and **.ntx86** platform extensions are optional on all sections that support platform extensions, do not use an **.nt** or **.ntx86** platform extension on the names of sections that install components on x86-based systems.

To create a single cross-operating system and cross-platform INF file for Microsoft Windows 2000 and later versions of Windows, use the following process:

-   Use **.ntia64** platform extensions on the names of sections that are required to install components on Itanium-based systems, and use **.ntamd64** platform extensions on the names of sections that are required to install components on x64-based systems.

To create a single cross-operating system and cross-platform INF file for a device that does not have operating system-specific requirements, supports all platform types, and that supports Windows 2000 and later versions of Windows, do the following:

1. Create a valid INF file that contains the generic entries that are required in all INF files, as described in [General Guidelines for INF Files](general-guidelines-for-inf-files.md).

2. Include an INF **Manufacturer** section that includes a *manufacturer-identifier* that specifies the *Models* section name for a device and a platform extension entry for each platform that the device supports. For example, the following Manufacturer section specifies a *Models* section name of "AbcModelSection" and the platform extensions **.ntia64** and **.ntamd64**. (Do not specify the **.ntx86** platform extension.)

   ```cpp
   [Manufacturer]
   ; The manufacturer-identifier for the Abc device.
   %ManufacturerName%=AbcModelSection,ntia64,ntamd64
   ```

3. Include a *Models* section whose name does not include a platform extension. Starting with Windows 2000, the operating system processes this section for x86-based systems. For example, the following AbcModelSection section specifies an *install-section-name* of "AbcInstallSection" for an Abc device.

   ```cpp
   [AbcModelSection]
   %AbcDeviceName%=AbcInstallSection,Abc-hw-id
   ```

4. Include a <em>Models</em>**.ntia64** section. Windows Server 2003 SP1 and later versions require a <em>Models</em>**.ntia64** section for Itanium-based systems. If a <em>Models</em>**.ntia64** section exists, Windows Server 2003 and Windows XP also use this section for Itanium-based systems. For example, the following AbcModelSection<strong>.ntia64</strong> section specifies an *install-section-name* of "AbcInstallSection.ntia64" for an Abc device.

   ```cpp
   [AbcModelSection.ntia64]
   %AbcDeviceName%=AbcInstallSection.ntia64,Abc-hw-id
   ```

5. Include a <em>Models</em>**.ntamd64** section. Windows Server 2003 SP1 and later versions require a <em>Models</em>**.ntamd64** section for x64-based systems. If a <em>Models</em>**.ntamd64** section exists, Windows Server 2003 and Windows XP also use this section for x64-based systems. For example, the following AbcModelSection<strong>.ntamd64</strong> section specifies an *install-section-name* of "AbcInstallSection.ntamd64" for an Abc device.

   ```cpp
   AbcModelSectionName.ntamd64
   %AbcDeviceName%=AbcInstallSection.ntamd64,Abc-hw-id
   ```

6. Include a *DDInstall* section whose name is the same as the *install-section-name* that is specified by the *Models* section that does not include a platform extension. For example, the AbcModelSection section specifies the following AbcInstallSection section. Windows processes this section to install the Abc device on x86-based systems that run Windows 2000 or later versions of Windows.

   ```cpp
   [AbcInstallSection]
   ; Install section entries go here.
   ...
   ```

7. Include a <em>DDInstall</em>**.ntia64** section whose name is the same as the *install-section-name* that is specified by the <em>Models</em>**.ntia64** section. For example, the AbcModelSection<strong>.ntia64</strong> section specifies the following AbcInstallSection<strong>.ntia64</strong> section. Windows processes this section to install the Abc device on Itanium-based systems that run Windows XP or later versions of Windows.

   ```cpp
   [AbcInstallSection.ntia64]
   ; Install section entries go here.
   ...
   ```

8. Include a <em>DDInstall</em>**.ntamd64** section whose name is the same as the *install-section-name* that is specified by the <em>Models</em>**.ntamd64** section. For example, the AbcModelSection<strong>.ntamd64</strong> section specifies the following AbcInstallSection<strong>.ntamd64</strong> section. Windows processes this section to install the Abc device on x64-based systems that run Windows XP or later versions of Windows.

   ```cpp
   [AbcInstallSection.ntamd64]
   ; Install section entries go here.
   ...
   ```

9. Include additional device-specific sections that are required for an x86-based installation. Do not include an **.ntx86** platform extension on the names of these sections. Windows processes these sections by default to install the device on x86-based systems that run Windows 2000 or later versions of Windows.

10. Include additional device-specific sections that are required for Itanium-based systems that run Windows XP or later versions of Windows. Include the **.ntia64** extension on these section names.

11. Include additional device-specific sections that are required for x64-based systems that run Windows XP or later versions of Windows. Include the **.ntamd64** extension on these section names.
