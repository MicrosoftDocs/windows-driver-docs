# Container IDs for eSATA Devices


The External Serial Advanced Technology Attachment (eSATA) bus cannot report a container ID. When the Windows operating system determines the device container grouping for an eSATA device, it relies on the removable capability that the ATA bus driver returns.

The ATA bus driver determines that the eSATA device is removable by reading the following Advanced Host Controller Interface (AHCI) register bits.

The ATA bus driver marks any device that is attached to the eSATA port as removable if one of the following is true:

-   The HPCP bit is set to 1, which indicates that the eSATA port is an external port that supports hot-plug operations.

-   The SXS and ESP bits are both set to 1, which indicates that the SATA port is an external signal-only port.

**Note**   These conditions are mutually exclusive. An eSATA port may declare itself to be either an external hot-plug-capable port or an external signal-only port, but not both.

 

For more information about the SATA and eSATA interface, refer to the [Serial ATA Advanced Host Controller Interface (AHCI) 1.3 specification](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/io/serial-ata/serial-ata-ahci-spec-rev1-3-1.html).
