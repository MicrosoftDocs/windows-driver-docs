# DEVPROP_TYPE_SECURITY_DESCRIPTOR


In Windows Vista and later versions of Windows, the DEVPROP_TYPE_SECURITY_DESCRIPTOR identifier represents the base-data-type identifier that indicates the data type is a variable-length, self-relative, SECURITY_DESCRIPTOR-typed, security descriptor.

## Remarks

DEVPROP_TYPE_SECURITY_DESCRIPTOR cannot be combined with the property-data-type modifiers.

### Setting a Property of this Type

To set a property whose base data type is DEVPROP_TYPE_SECURITY_DESCRIPTOR, call the corresponding **SetupDiSet*Xxx*** property function and set the function input parameters as follows:

-   Set the *PropertyType* parameter to DEVPROP_TYPE_SECURITY_DESCRIPTOR, set the *PropertyBuffer* parameter to a pointer to a buffer that contains a variable length SECURITY_DESCRIPTOR structure, and set the *PropertyBufferSize* parameter to the size, in bytes, of the security descriptor structure.

-   Set the other function input parameters as appropriate to set the property.
