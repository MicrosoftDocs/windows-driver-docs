The **deleteBinaries** XML element is an empty element that sets the **deleteBinaries** flag to ON, which configures DPInst to delete binary files from a system that were copied to the system when a [driver package](./driver-packages.md) was installed.

**Element Tag**

```cpp
<deleteBinaries>
```

**XML Attributes**

None

**Element Information**

<table>
<colgroup>
<col width="50%" />
<col width="50%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="left"><p><strong>Parent elements</strong></p></td>
<td align="left"><p><a href="dpinst-xml-element.md" data-raw-source="[&lt;strong&gt;dpinst&lt;/strong&gt;](dpinst-xml-element.md)"><strong>dpinst</strong></a></p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td align="left"><p><strong>Child elements</strong></p></td>
<td align="left"><p>None</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="left"><p><strong>Data contents</strong></p></td>
<td align="left"><p>None permitted</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td align="left"><p><strong>Duplicate child elements</strong></p></td>
<td align="left"><p>None permitted</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

## Remarks

By default, the **deleteBinaries** flag is set to OFF. To set the **deleteBinaries** flag to ON, include a **deleteBinaries** element as a child element of a **dpinst** element or use the **/d**Â DPInst command-line switch.

The following code example demonstrates a **deleteBinaries** element.

```cpp
<dpinst>
  ...
   <deleteBinaries/>
  ...
</dpinst>
```

> [!NOTE]
> Starting with Windows 7, the operating system ignores a setting of ON for the **deleteBinaries** XML element. The binary files, which were copied to a system when a [driver package](./driver-packages.md) was installed, can no longer be deleted by using DPInst.
