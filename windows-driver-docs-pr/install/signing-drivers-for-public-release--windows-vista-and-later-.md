# Signing Drivers for Public Release


Release-signing identifies the publisher of a kernel-mode binary (for example, driver or *.dll*) that loads into WindowsÂ Vista and later versions of Windows. Kernel-mode binaries are release-signed through either:

-   A [WHQL Release Signature](whql-release-signature.md) obtained through the [Windows Logo Program](/windows-hardware/drivers).

-   A release signature created through a [Software Publisher Certificate (SPC)](./deprecation-of-software-publisher-certificates-and-commercial-release-certificates.md).

To understand the steps that are involved in release-signing [driver packages](driver-packages.md), review the following topics:

This topic describes the reasons why release-signing a driver package is important, and provides a high-level summary of the release-signing process.

This topic provides a high-level overview of the release-signing process, and reviews many examples of release-signing by using the *ToastPkg* sample driver package within the Windows Driver Kit (WDK).
