# Code 16 - CM_PROB_PARTIAL_LOG_CONF

This Device Manager error message indicates that the device is only partially configured.

## Error Code

### Display Message

"Windows cannot identify all the resources this device uses. (Code 16)"

"To specify additional resources for this device, click the Resources tab and fill in the missing settings. Check your hardware documentation to find out what settings to use."

### Recommended Resolution

Manually configure the resources that the device requires.

To configure device resources, follow these steps:

1. [Open Device Manager](using-device-manager.md).

2. Double-click the icon that represents the device in the Device Manager window.

3. On the device properties sheet that appears, click the **Resources** tab. The device resources are listed in the **resource settings** list on the **Resources** page.

4. If a resource in the **resource settings** list has a question mark next to it, select that resource to assign it to the device.

5. If a resource cannot be changed, click **Change Settings**. If **Change Settings** is unavailable, try to clear the **Use automatic settings** check box to make it available.

If the device is not a Plug and Play device, look in the device documentation for more information about how to configure resources for the device.
