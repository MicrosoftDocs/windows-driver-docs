# Driver Packages

A *driver package* is a collection of software components that enable a Windows device to work properly. If you want to create a new device, you should follow industry hardware standards. This will make your development process easier and cheaper. You may also find test suites and generic driver packages for standard devices, so you may not need to provide your own driver package.

Every device on a Windows system needs a driver package. Windows provides some generic driver packages for some types of devices. For devices that are not supported by Windows, the device vendor should provide a custom driver package. The vendor can also provide a custom driver package a device that is supported by Windows in order to provide enhanced functionality.

This section explains what components you need to include in your driver package.
