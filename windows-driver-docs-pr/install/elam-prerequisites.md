# ELAM Prerequisites


Early Launch Antimalware drivers must adhere to the following program requirements to be signed by **WHQL** and loaded by Windows.

## Antimalware Vendor Participation Requirements


Microsoft requires that Early Launch Antimalware vendors be members of the **[Microsoft Virus Initiative (MVI)](/windows/security/threat-protection/intelligence/virus-initiative-criteria)**. This membership ensures that the vendors are active antimalware community participants with a positive industry reputation. If you are not a member of the MVI program and believe you need use of ELAM, please reach out to **[mvi@microsoft.com](mailto:mvi@microsoft.com)** for additional information.


## Windows Hardware Quality Lab (WHQL) submission

- Â  Submit your driver for verification as documented at [ELAM Driver Submission](elam-driver-submission.md)
-   The **WHQL** process will verify that the vendor is permitted to submit early launch drivers.  Your submission will fail if you are not an MVI member.
