# Identifiers for USB devices

This section describes the device, hardware and compatible identifiers generated by USB devices.

Since the Windows operating system generates special USB identifiers for printer and mass storage devices, the following documentation divides USB identifiers into the following two groups.

## Standard USB identifiers

- [Standard USB Identifiers](standard-usb-identifiers.md)

## Special USB identifiers

- [Identifiers Generated by USBSTOR.SYS](identifiers-generated-by-usbstor-sys.md)

- [Identifiers Generated by USBPRINT.SYS](identifiers-generated-by-usbprint-sys.md)

For all USB devices, the USB bus driver generates a standard set of identifiers composed of values retrieved from the USB device and interface descriptors. Standard USB Identifiers are discussed in the first of the two sections indicated above. In addition to the standard USB identifiers, native Windows drivers for mass storage and printer devices generate a separate set of USB identifiers composed of information about special relevance to printers and storage devices. These special USB identifiers are discussed in the second section.

> [!NOTE]
> The numbers that are embedded in USB identifiers are in hexadecimal format.
