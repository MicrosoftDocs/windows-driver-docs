# Test-Signing a Driver Binary through an Embedded Signature

A signed [catalog file](catalog-files.md) is all that you must have to correctly install and load most [driver packages](driver-packages.md). However, embedded-signing of some binaries in the driver package might also be required for some scenarios. Embedded-signing refers to adding a digital signature to the driver's binary image file itself, instead of relying on the digital signature in a catalog file. As a result, the driver's binary image is modified when the driver is embedded-signed.

Embedded-signing of kernel-mode binaries is required whenever the driver is a boot-start driver. In 64-bit versions of Windows Vista and later versions of Windows, the kernel-mode code signing requirements state that a *boot-start driver* must have an embedded signature. Note that this is in addition to the catalog file of the driver package needing to meet [PnP Device Installation Signing Requirements](pnp-device-installation-signing-requirements--windows-vista-and-later-.md).

As with [catalog files](catalog-files.md), [**SignTool**](../devtest/signtool.md) is used to embed a digital signature within kernel-mode binary files by using a test certificate. The following command line shows how to run SignTool to do the following:

- Test-sign the 64-bit version of the Toastpkg sample's binary file, toaster.sys. Within the WDK installation directory, this file is located in the *src\\general\\toaster\\toastpkg\\toastcd\\amd64* directory.

- Use the Contoso.com(Test) certificate from the PrivateCertStore for the test signature. For more information about how this certificate was created, see [Creating Test Certificates](creating-test-certificates.md).

- Time stamp the digital signature through a time stamp authority (TSA).

To test-sign the *toaster.sys* file, run the following command line:

```cpp
Signtool sign /v /fd sha256 /s PrivateCertStore /n Contoso.com(Test) /t http://timestamp.digicert.com amd64\toaster.sys
```

Where:

- The **sign** command configures SignTool to sign the specified catalog file, tstamd64.cat.

- The **/v** option enables verbose operations, in which SignTool displays successful execution and warning messages.

- The **/fd** option specifies the file digest algorithm to use for creating file signatures. The default is SHA1.

- The **/s** option specifies the name of the certificate store (*PrivateCertStore)* that contains the test certificate.

- The **/n** option specifies the name of the certificate (*Contoso.com(Test))* that is installed in the specified certificate store.

- The **/t** option specifies URL of the TSA (`http://timestamp.digicert.com`) which will time stamp the digital signature.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Including a time stamp provides the necessary information for key revocation in case the signer's code signing private key is compromised.

- *amd64\\toaster.sys* specifies the name of the kernel-mode binary file which will be embedded-signed.
