# DIF_INSTALLWIZARD


This DIF code is obsolete and no longer supported in Microsoft Windows 2000 and later versions of Windows.

For PnP devices, Windows uses the DIF_NEWDEVICEWIZARD_*XXX* requests instead, such as [**DIF_NEWDEVICEWIZARD_FINISHINSTALL**](dif-newdevicewizard-finishinstall.md).
