# Sample Device Installation Files

The Windows Driver Kit (WDK) includes various sample installation files, such as INF files, device installation applications, and property page providers.

Most sample installation files are located under the *src\\setup* subdirectory of the WDK. Also see the *src\\general\\toaster* subdirectory of the WDK.
