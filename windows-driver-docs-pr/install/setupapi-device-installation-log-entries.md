# SetupAPI Device Installation Log Entries


In Windows Vista and later versions of Windows, [SetupAPI logs](setupapi-logging--windows-vista-and-later-.md) information about device installation in a plain-text log file that you can use to verify the installation of a device and to troubleshoot device installation problems. If a signing problem exists, SetupAPI will log information about the signing problem in the log file. The name of this log file is *SetupAPI.dev.log*, and it is located, by default, in the Windows INF file directory (*%SystemRoot%\\inf*).
