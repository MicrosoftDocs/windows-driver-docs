# Using SetupAPI To Verify Driver Authenticode Signatures

You can use the following procedures to verify that a driver package has a valid Authenticode [digital signature](digital-signatures.md). These procedures are supported starting with Microsoft Windows Server 2003.

### To determine whether a driver has a valid Authenticode signature

Check the DNF_AUTHENTICODE_SIGNED flag.

If a driver package has a valid Authenticode signature, Windows sets this flag in the **Flags** member of the driver node's [**SP_DRVINSTALL_PARAMS**](/windows/win32/api/setupapi/ns-setupapi-sp_drvinstall_params) structure. (Also be aware that Windows sets the DNF_INF_IS_SIGNED flag if the driver has a [WHQL release signature](whql-release-signature.md), if it is a system-supplied driver, or if it has an Authenticode signature.)

### To verify that an INF file has a valid Authenticode signature

1.  Call [**SetupVerifyInfFile**](/windows/win32/api/setupapi/nf-setupapi-setupverifyinffilew).

2.  Check the error code that was returned by the function.

    If the INF file is not system-supplied and does not have a valid WHQL digital signature, but it does have a valid Authenticode signature, **SetupVerifyInfFile** returns **FALSE** and [GetLastError](/windows/win32/api/errhandlingapi/nf-errhandlingapi-getlasterror) returns one of the following error codes:

    <a href="" id="error-authenticode-trusted-publisher"></a>ERROR_AUTHENTICODE_TRUSTED_PUBLISHER  
    Indicates that the publisher is trusted because the publisher's certificate is installed in the [Trusted Publishers certificate store](trusted-publishers-certificate-store.md).

    <a href="" id="error-authenticode-trust-not-established"></a>ERROR_AUTHENTICODE_TRUST_NOT_ESTABLISHED  
    Indicates that trust cannot be automatically established because the publisher's signing certificate is not installed in the trusted publisher certificates store. However, this does not necessarily indicate an error. Instead it indicates that the caller must apply a caller-specific policy to establish trust in the publisher.

If the INF file has a valid Authenticode signature, **SetupVerifyInfFile** also returns the following information in the SP_INF_SIGNER_INFO output structure:

-   The **DigitalSigner** member is set to the name of the signer.

-   The **CatalogFile** member is set to the full path of the corresponding signed catalog file.

However, be aware that **SetupVerifyInfFile** does not return the version in the **DigitalSignerVersion** member.

### To verify that a file has a valid Authenticode signature

Call the SetupAPI function **SetupScanFileQueue** by using the SPQ_SCAN_USE_CALLBACK_SIGNERINFO flag.

**SetupScanFileQueue** sends an SPFILENOTIFY_QUEUESCAN_SIGNERINFO request to the caller's callback routine and passes a pointer to a FILEPATHS_SIGNERINFO structure. If a file is signed with a valid Authenticode signature, the function sets the error code to the appropriate ERROR_AUTHENTICODE_Xxx value before calling the callback routine for a file. The function also sets the following information in the FILEPATHS_SIGNERINFO structure:

-   The **DigitalSigner** member is set to the name of the signer.

-   The **CatalogFile** member is set to the full path of the corresponding signed catalog file.

However, be aware that the version is not set in the **Version** member.

**SetupScanFileQueue** sets the ERROR_AUTHENTICODE_Xxx error code in the same way as described earlier in this topic for **SetupVerifyInfFile**.
