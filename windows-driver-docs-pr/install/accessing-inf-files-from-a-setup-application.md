# Accessing INF Files from a Device Installation Application





Most INF files are used by system class installers and other *device installation applications*. This section describes common operations that vendor-supplied device installation applications can perform on INF files by using the [general Setup functions](/previous-versions/ff544985(v=vs.85)). For complete information about how to use these functions, see the Windows SDK documentation.

This section contains the following topics:
