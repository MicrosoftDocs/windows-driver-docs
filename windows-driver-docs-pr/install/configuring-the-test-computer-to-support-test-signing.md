# Configuring the Test Computer to Support Test-Signing


Before you install a test-signed driver package on a test computer, you must configure the computer to support test-signing. This section describes the procedures involved with enabling test-signing support on a computer, and includes the following topics:

[The TESTSIGNING Boot Configuration Option](the-testsigning-boot-configuration-option.md)

[Enabling Code Integrity Event Logging and System Auditing](enabling-code-integrity-event-logging-and-system-auditing.md)

Once the test computer is reconfigured to enable test-signing, the computer must be restarted for the changes to take effect.
