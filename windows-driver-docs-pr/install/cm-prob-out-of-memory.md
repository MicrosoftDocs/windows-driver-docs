### Recommended Resolution

If a device driver is corrupted, update the driver.

To update a device driver, follow these steps:

1. [Open Device Manager](using-device-manager.md).

2. Right-click the icon that represents the device in the Device Manager window.

To check available memory and system resources, follow these steps:

1. Click the **Start** menu.

2. Point to the following sequence of submenus: **All Programs**, **Accessories**, and **System Tools**.

3. On the **System Tools** menu, click **System Information** to determine whether the amount of available physical memory is sufficient to operate the device.

You might have to install additional random access memory (RAM) to operate a device.
