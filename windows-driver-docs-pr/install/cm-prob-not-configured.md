# CM_PROB_NOT_CONFIGURED


## <a href="" id="ddk-cm-prob-not-configured-dg"></a>


There is a device on the system for which there is no **ConfigFlags** registry entry. This means no driver is installed. Typically this means an INF file could not be found.

### Error Code

1

### Display Message (Windows 2000 and later versions of Windows)

"This device is not configured correctly. (Code 1)"

"To Update the drivers for this device, click Update Driver. If that doesn't work, see your hardware documentation for more information."

### Recommended Resolution (Windows 2000 and later versions of Windows)

Select **Update Driver**, which starts the Hardware Update wizard.
