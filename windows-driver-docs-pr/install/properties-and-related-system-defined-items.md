# Properties and Related System-Defined Items


In Windows Vista and later versions of Windows, the unified device property model manages the correspondence between the following system-defined items that pertain to the installation and management of devices:

-   The [system-defined properties](system-defined-device-properties2.md) and their corresponding [property keys](property-keys.md), [property data types](property-data-type-identifiers.md), and property values.

-   The SPDRP_*Xxx* device instance property identifiers and the SPCRP_*Xxx* device setup class property identifiers that are defined in *Setupapi.h.* The CM_DRP_*Xxx* device instance property identifiers and the CM_CRP_*Xxx*[device setup class](device-setup-classes.md) identifiers that are defined in *Cfgmgr32.h*.

-   The REGSTR_VAL_*Xxx* registry entry value identifiers that pertain to device installation and management. These identifiers are defined in *Regstr.h*.

-   Registry entry values that correspond to device properties.

-   INF file entry values that modify device properties.
