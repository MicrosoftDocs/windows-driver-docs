# Using SetupAPI and Configuration Manager to Access Device Properties


Windows Server 2003, Windows XP, and Windows 2000 support device property representations that correspond to most of the system-defined device properties that are supported by the [unified device property model](unified-device-property-model--windows-vista-and-later-.md) of Windows Vista and later versions of Windows.

On these earlier versions of Windows, [SetupAPI functions](setupapi.md), [configuration manager functions](/windows/win32/api/cfgmgr32/), and Windows registry functions can be used to access device properties, as described in the following topics:

[Accessing Device Instance SPDRP_Xxx Properties](accessing-device-instance-spdrp-xxx-properties.md)

[Retrieving a Device Instance Identifier](retrieving-a-device-instance-identifier.md)

[Accessing Device Instance Driver Properties](accessing-device-driver-properties.md)

[Retrieving the Status and Problem Code for a Device Instance](retrieving-the-status-and-problem-code-for-a-device-instance.md)

[Retrieving Device Relations](retrieving-device-relations.md)

[Accessing Device Setup Class Properties](accessing-device-setup-class-properties.md)

[Accessing Device Interface Class Properties](accessing-device-interface-class-properties.md)

[Accessing Device Interface Properties](accessing-device-interface-properties--windows-vista-and-later-.md)

[Accessing Custom Device Properties](accessing-custom-device-properties.md)
