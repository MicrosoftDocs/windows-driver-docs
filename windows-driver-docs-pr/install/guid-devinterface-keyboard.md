## Remarks

Drivers for keyboard devices register instances of this device interface class to notify the system and applications of the presence of keyboard devices.

The system-supplied [keyboard class driver](../hid/keyboard-and-mouse-class-drivers.md) registers an instance of this device interface class for a keyboard device. Access an instance of this device interface class by using the I/O interface supported by the keyboard class driver.

For general information about supporting keyboard devices, see [HID Architecture](../hid/hid-architecture.md) and [Features of the Kbdclass and Mouclass Drivers](../hid/keyboard-and-mouse-class-drivers.md).

The WDK includes sample code for the system-supplied keyboard class driver. The keyboard class driver uses the obsolete identifier [**GUID_CLASS_KEYBOARD**](guid-class-keyboard.md) to register an instance of this [device setup class](./overview-of-device-setup-classes.md).

For information about the device interface class for mouse devices, see [**GUID_DEVINTERFACE_MOUSE**](guid-devinterface-mouse.md).
