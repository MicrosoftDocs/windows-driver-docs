# DIF_FINISHINSTALL_ACTION


A DIF_FINISHINSTALL_ACTION request allows an installer to run finish-install actions in an interactive administrator context after all other device installation operations have completed.

### When Sent

In Windows 8 and later versions, finish-install actions do not automatically run as part of device installation. To complete a device finish-install action, a user must click on “Finish installing device software” in the Action Center to complete the installation.

For more information, see [Running Finish-Install Actions](./running-finish-install-actions.md).

In Windows 7, the finish-install process runs only in the context of a user with administrator credentials at one of the following times:

-   The next time that a user who has administrator credentials logs on while the device is attached.
-   When the device is reattached.
-   When the user selects Scan for hardware changes in Device Manager.

If a user is signed in without administrative privileges, Windows prompts the user for consent and credentials to run the finish-install actions in an administrator context.

### Installer Input

<a href="" id="deviceinfoset"></a>*DeviceInfoSet*  
A handle to the [device information set](./device-information-sets.md) that contains the device being installed.

<a href="" id="deviceinfodata"></a>*DeviceInfoData*  
A pointer to an [**SP_DEVINFO_DATA**](/windows/win32/api/setupapi/ns-setupapi-sp_devinfo_data) structure that represents the device being installed.

<a href="" id="device-installation-parameters-"></a>Device Installation Parameters   
There are device installation parameters (a [**SP_DEVINSTALL_PARAMS**](/windows/win32/api/setupapi/ns-setupapi-sp_devinstall_params_a) structure) associated with *DeviceInfoData*.

<a href="" id="class-installation-parameters"></a>Class Installation Parameters  
None

### Installer Output

<a href="" id="device-installation-parameters-"></a>Device Installation Parameters   
An installer sets the DI_NEEDREBOOT flag if a system restart is required to complete its finish-install actions.

### Installer Return Value

An installer returns one of the values that are listed in the following table.

<td align="left"><p>Class installer: The installer has no finish-install actions, has successfully completed the finish-install actions, or has determined that it cannot ever successfully complete its finish install actions. Device installation should perform the default processing for the request.</p>

<tr class="even">
<td align="left"><p>NO_ERROR</p></td>
<td align="left"><p>Class installer: A class installer should not return this error code. If a class installer returns this error code, device installation does not perform the default processing for the request.</p>
<p>Co-installer: The installer has no finish-install actions, has successfully completed the finish-install actions, or has determined that it cannot ever successfully complete its finish install actions.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="left"><p>Win32 error code</p></td>
<td align="left"><p>Class installer or co-installer: The installer encountered an error while processing a finish-install action, and device installation should attempt to complete the finish-install actions the next time the device is enumerated in the context of an administrator.</p></td>

### Default DIF Code Handler

Windows 7 uses [**SetupDiFinishInstallAction**](/previous-versions/windows/hardware/previsioning-framework/ff551022(v=vs.85)).

There is no default DIF Code Handler in Windows 8 and later versions, and [**SetupDiFinishInstallAction**](/previous-versions/windows/hardware/previsioning-framework/ff551022(v=vs.85)) has been removed.

### Comments

Because device installation cannot determine from an ERROR_DI_DO_DEFAULT return code or a NO_ERROR return code whether a finish-install action actually succeeded, the installer should notify the user of the status of a finish-installer action.
