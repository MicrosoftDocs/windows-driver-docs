# Identifiers for PCMCIA Devices





For Personal Computer Memory Card International Association (PCMCIA) devices, the device ID can take several different forms. For devices that are not multifunctional, the device identifier is formatted as follows:

PCMCIA\\Manufacturer-Product-Crc(4)

Where:

-   *Manufacturer* is the name of the manufacturer.

-   *Product* is the name of the product.

The PCMCIA enumerator retrieves these strings directly from tuples on the card. Both *Manufacturer* and *Product* are variable-length strings that do not exceed 64 characters. *Crc(4)* is the 4-digit hexadecimal CRC (cyclic redundancy check) checksum for the card. Numbers less than four digits long have a leading zero fill. For example, the device ID for a network adapter might be this:

PCMCIA\\MEGAHERTZ-CC10BT/2-BF05

For a multifunction card, every function has an identifier of the form:

PCMCIA\\Manufacturer-Product-DEVd(4)-Crc(4)

The child function number (*d(4)* in this example) is a decimal number without leading zeros.

If the card does not have a name of the manufacturer, the identifier has one of these three forms:

PCMCIA\\UNKNOWN_MANUFACTURER-Crc(4)

PCMCIA\\UNKNOWN_MANUFACTURER-DEVd(4)-Crc(4)

PCMCIA\\MTD-MemoryType(4)

The last of these three alternatives is for a flash memory card without a manufacturer identifier on the card. *MemoryType(4)* is one of two 4-digit hexadecimal numbers: 0000 for SRAM cards and 0002 for ROM cards.

In addition to the various forms of device ID just described, an INF file's [**Models section**](inf-models-section.md) can also contain a hardware ID composed by replacing the 4-digit hexadecimal cyclic redundancy check (CRC) with a string that contains the 4-digit hexadecimal manufacturer code, a hyphen, and the 4-digit hexadecimal manufacturer information code (both from on-board tuples). For example:

PCMCIA\\MEGAHERTZ-CC10BT/2-0128-0103

PCMCIA-compatible IDs correspond to the generic device IDs mentioned in the [Generic Identifiers](generic-identifiers.md) section. Currently, PCMCIA-compatible IDs are generated for only three device types as described in the following table.
