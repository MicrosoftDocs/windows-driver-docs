# Driver Package Rank Example

Consider a device that has the following lists of [device identification strings](device-identification-strings.md), where the HwID_*N* and CID_*N* names are placeholders for actual [hardware IDs](hardware-ids.md) and [compatible IDs](compatible-ids.md):

-   List of hardware IDs
    ```cpp
     HwID_1, HwID_2
    ```

-   List of compatible IDs
    ```cpp
    CID_1, CID_2
    ```

The first hardware ID in a list of hardware IDs is the most specific identifier for the device. In this example, that is HwID_1.

Also assume there is a [driver package](driver-packages.md) INF file that has an [**INF *Models* section**](inf-models-section.md) that has the following entry, where the INF_*XXX_N* names are placeholders for actual hardware IDs and compatible IDs:

```cpp
DeviceDesc1 = InstallSection1, INF_HwID_1, INF_CID_1, INF_CID_2
```

In addition, assume that the INF *DDInstall* section named *InstallSection1* has the following **FeatureScore** directive, where the corresponding feature score of the driver is 0x00*GG*0000:

```cpp
FeatureScore=0xGG
```

The following table lists the rank of each possible match between the identifiers that are reported by the device and the identifiers that are listed in the INF *Models* section entry. The rank is the sum of the [signature score](signature-score--windows-vista-and-later-.md), which is represented by 0x*SS*000000, the [feature score](feature-score--windows-vista-and-later-.md), which is represented by 0x00*GG*0000, and the [identifier score](identifier-score--windows-vista-and-later-.md), which depends, in each case, on the two identifiers that matched.
