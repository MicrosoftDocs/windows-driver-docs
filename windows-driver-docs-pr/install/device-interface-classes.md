# Device Interface Classes





Device interface classes are the means by which drivers make devices available to applications and other drivers.

This section contains the following topics:

[Overview of Device Interface Classes](overview-of-device-interface-classes.md)

[Registering a Device Interface Class](registering-a-device-interface-class.md)

[Enabling and Disabling a Device Interface Instance](enabling-and-disabling-a-device-interface-instance.md)

[Using a Device Interface](using-a-device-interface.md)

For information about the system-defined device interface classes, see [System-Defined Device Interface Classes](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff553412).
