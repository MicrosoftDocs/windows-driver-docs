# Overview of the Device Metadata System


Starting with Windows 7, the device metadata system provides an end-to-end process to distribute device metadata packages. The components of this system are described in the following topics:

[Windows Metadata and Internet Services](windows-metadata-and-internet-services.md)

[Device Metadata Retrieval Client](device-metadata-retrieval-client.md)

[Device Metadata Store](device-metadata-store.md)

[Device Metadata Cache](device-metadata-cache.md)
