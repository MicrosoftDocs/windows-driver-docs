# Using ACPI to Configure USB Ports on a Computer


If the system requires ACPI BIOS changes to accurately reflect the USB port configuration, you should consider the user's ability to connect a device to the port when you configure the port.

If you use ACPI to specify the configuration of a USB port, you must define the USB port capabilities (**_UPC**) and physical location description (**_PLD**) objects. Although the ACPI 6.0 specification does not specifically prohibit the use of only the **_UPC** object, the use of both objects more precisely indicates the user's ability to connect devices to the port. Using only the **_UPC** object might not set the device container grouping correctly or as expected.

Devices that are attached to the port are removable from the hub if the **DeviceRemovable** bit is set. The following table shows how the values of the ACPI objects for a given port affect the value of the USB hub descriptor **DeviceRemovable** bit that Windows reports for the device.

**Note**   It is an invalid configuration to define a port as not connectable but visible to the user.

 

The following examples show correctly formed ACPI Source Language (ASL) that demonstrates the use of the **_UPC** and **_PLD** objects to describe a USB port:

-   To specify a port that is internal (not user visible) and can be connected to an integrated device, the **_UPC.PortIsConnectable** byte must be set to 0xFF and the **_PLD.UserVisible** bit must be set to 0.

    In the following example the device is grouped with the computer's device container.

    ```cpp
    Name(_UPC, Package(){
        0xFF,         // Port is connectable
        0xFF,         // Connector type (N/A for non-visible ports)
        0x00000000,   // Reserved 0, must be zero
        0x00000000})  // Reserved 1, must be zero

    Name(_PLD, Buffer(0x10){
        0x81, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00,
        0x30, 0x1C, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00})
    ```

-   To specify a port that is external (user visible) and can be connected to an external device, the **_UPC.PortIsConnectable** byte must be set to 0xFF and the **_PLD.UserVisible** bit must be set to 1. The _**UPC**.**PortConnectorType** byte must be set to the appropriate USB connector type as specified in Section 9.13 of the ACPI 3.0 specification.

    In the following example the device is assigned a new device container and is displayed as a separate physical device.

    ```cpp
    Name(_UPC, Package(){
        0xFF,         // Port is connectable
        0x00,         // Connector type, Type 'A' in this case
        0x00000000,   // Reserved 0, must be zero
        0x00000000})  // Reserved 1, must be zero

    Name(_PLD, Buffer(0x10){
        0x81, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00,
        0x31, 0x1C, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00})
    ```
    
A USB Type-C connector must be correctly described in ACPI in order to pass the [USB Type-C ACPI Validation](/windows-hardware/test/hlk/testref/b3c41a3f-b844-4c2d-b115-dad51a37f123) Hardware Lab Kit test.

Example _UPC for a USB Type-C connector:
```cpp
      Name(_UPC, Package(4){
        0x01,                       // Port is connectable
        0x09,                       // Connector type: Type C connector - USB2 and SS with Switch
        0x00000000,                 // Reserved0 – must be zero
        0x00000000})                // Reserved1 – must be zero
```
