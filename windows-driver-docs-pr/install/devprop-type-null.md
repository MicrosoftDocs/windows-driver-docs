# DEVPROP_TYPE_NULL


In Windows Vista and later versions of Windows, the DEVPROP_TYPE_NULL identifier represents a special base-data-type identifier that indicates that a device property exists. However, that the property has no value that is associated with the property.

## Remarks

Use this base-property-type identifier with the device property functions to delete the value that is associated with a device property.

If a device property function returns this base data type, the property exists, but the property has no value that is associated with it.

The DEVPROP_TYPE_NULL identifier cannot be combined with the property-data-type modifiers [**DEVPROP_TYPEMOD_ARRAY**](devprop-typemod-array.md) or [**DEVPROP_TYPEMOD_LIST**](devprop-typemod-list.md).

**Setting a Property of this Type**

To set a property whose data type is DEVPROP_TYPE_NULL, call the corresponding **SetupDiSet*Xxx*** property function and set the function parameters as follows:

-   Set the *PropertyType* parameter to DEVPROP_TYPE_NULL, the *PropertyBuffer* parameter to **NULL**, and the *PropertyBufferSize* parameter to zero.

-   Set the other function input parameters as appropriate to set the property.

**Retrieving a Property of this Type**

A call to a **SetupDiGet*Xxx*** property function that attempts to retrieve a device property that has no value will succeed and set the \**PropertyType* parameter to DEVPROP_TYPE_NULL.
