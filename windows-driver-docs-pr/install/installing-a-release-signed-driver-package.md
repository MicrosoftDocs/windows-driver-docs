# Installing a Release-Signed Driver Package


The release-signed [driver package](driver-packages.md) can be installed on the computer through:

-   The [DevCon](../devtest/devcon.md) tool, which is a WDK command line tool for installing drivers. For more information, see [Using the DevCon Tool to Install a Driver Package](using-the-devcon-tool-to-install-a-driver-package.md).

You can troubleshoot problems with released-signed driver installation and loading through the methods described in [Troubleshooting Install and Load Problems with Signed Driver Packages](./detecting-driver-load-errors.md).
