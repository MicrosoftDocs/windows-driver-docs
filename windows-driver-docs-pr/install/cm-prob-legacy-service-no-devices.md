# CM_PROB_LEGACY_SERVICE_NO_DEVICES


## <a href="" id="ddk-cm-prob-legacy-service-no-devices-dg"></a>


A driver was loaded but Windows cannot find the device.

### Error Code

41

### Display Message (Windows XP and later versions of Windows)

"Windows successfully loaded the device driver for this hardware but cannot find the hardware device. (Code 41)"

### Recommended Resolution (Windows XP and later versions of Windows)

Reinstall the device.

This is a legacy root service that did not create a device object.
