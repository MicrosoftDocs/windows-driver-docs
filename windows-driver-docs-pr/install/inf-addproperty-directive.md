# INF AddProperty directive

An **AddProperty** directive references one or more INF file sections that modify the [device properties](device-properties.md) that are set for a device instance, a [device setup class](./overview-of-device-setup-classes.md), a [device interface class](./overview-of-device-interface-classes.md), or a device interface.

AddProperty=add-property-section[,add-property-section]...  (Windows Vista and later versions of Windows)
...
```

Each *add-property-section* can have entries to do the following:

- Add a device property and initialize the value of the property.

- Modify the value of an existing device property.

An *add-property-section* that is referenced by an **AddProperty** directive has the following format:

```inf
[add-property-section]
(property-name, , , [flags], value]) | 
({property-category-guid}, property-pid, type, [flags], value)
...
```

An add property section can have any number of *property-name* entries or *property-guid* entries, each on a separate line.

## Entries

*property-name*  
One of the following property names that represent the device instance [driver package](driver-packages.md) properties:

- **DeviceModel**

- **DeviceVendorWebsite**

- **DeviceDetailedDescription**

- **DeviceDocumentationLink**

- **DeviceIcon**

- **DeviceBrandingIcon**

For more info about adding custom device icons, see [Providing Icons for a Device](providing-vendor-icons-for-the-shell-and-autoplay.md).

*property-category-guid*  
A GUID value that identifies the property category. The GUID value can be a system-defined GUID that identifies one of the property categories for a device instance, a [device setup class](./overview-of-device-setup-classes.md), a [device interface class](./overview-of-device-interface-classes.md), or a device interface. All properties that have the same GUID value are members of the same category. These property categories are defined in *Devpkey.h*.

The GUID value can also be a custom GUID value that identifies a custom property category.

*property-pid*  
The property identifier that indicates the specific property within the property category that is indicated by the *property-category-guid* value. For internal system reasons, a property identifier must be greater than or equal to two.

*type*  
The numeric value, in decimal or hexadecimal format, of the [property-data-type identifier](/previous-versions/ff541476(v=vs.85)) for the property that is specified by the *property-category-guid* value and the *property-pid* value. Only the following [**base data types**](/previous-versions/ff537793(v=vs.85)) are supported:

- DEVPROP_TYPE_STRING

- DEVPROP_TYPE_STRING_LIST

- DEVPROP_TYPE_BINARY

- DEVPROP_TYPE_BOOLEAN

- DEVPROP_TYPE_UINT32

For example, the decimal value of the DEVPROP_TYPE_STRING data type is 18 (0x00000012) and the decimal value of the DEVPROP_TYPE_STRING_LIST data type is 8210 (0x00002012).

*flags*  
An optional hexadecimal value that is a bitwise OR of the following flags that control the add operation:

**0x00000001** (FLG_ADDPROPERTY_NOCLOBBER)  
A flag that prevents the value entry value from replacing the existing property value. If a driver writer wants to make a property able to be overridden through **Include** and **Needs** directives, the writer must specify this flag for that property. This is because Windows processes the INF sections that are referenced by **Include** and **Needs** directives after Windows processes all other directives within the INF section that included the **Include** and **Needs** directives.

**0x00000002** (FLG_ADDPROPERTY_OVERWRITEONLY)  
A flag that sets the property value to the value entry value only if the specified property already exists.

**0x00000004** (FLG_ADDPROPERTY_APPEND)  
A flag that appends the value entry value to that of an existing property string value. This flag is valid only if the property data type is DEVPROP_TYPE_STRING_LIST. The supplied string is not appended to an existing property string value if the supplied string is already present in the existing string value.

**0x00000008** (FLG_ADDPROPERTY_OR)  
A flag that performs a bitwise OR of the value entry value to that of the existing property value. This flag is valid only if the property data type is DEVPROP_TYPE_UINT32.

**0x00000010** (FLG_ADDPROPERTY_AND)  
A flag that performs a bitwise AND of the value entry value to that of the existing property value. This flag is valid only if the property data type is DEVPROP_TYPE_UINT32.

*value*  
The value that the add operation uses to modify a property value, depending on the property data type and the value of the *flags* entry.

## Remarks

The **AddProperty** directive can be used to modify a system-defined device property or a custom device property. This directive can be specified under any of the sections shown in the formal syntax statement above.

Each *add-property-section* name must be unique within an INF file, but the section can be referenced by more than one **AddProperty** directive in the same INF file. Each section name must follow the general rules for defining section names that are described in [General Syntax Rules for INF Files](general-syntax-rules-for-inf-files.md).

For more information about how to use the INF **AddProperty** directive, see [Using the INF AddProperty Directive and the INF DelProperty Directive](using-the-inf-addproperty-directive-and-the-inf-delproperty-directive.md).

## Examples

The following example of an add property section includes two line entries: the first line entry sets the **DeviceModel** property by name, and the second line entry sets a custom device property by specifying a custom property key GUID.

The first line includes the *property-name* entry value "DeviceModel" and the *value* entry value "Sample Device Model Name."

The second line entry sets a custom property in a custom property category. The property-category-guid entry value is "c22189e4-8bf3-4e6d-8467-8dc6d95e2a7e" and the property-identifier entry value is "2".

The optional *flags* entry value is not present, and the type entry value is "18" (DEVPROP_TYPE_STRING). The value entry value is "String value for property 1."

```inf
[SampleAddPropertySection]
DeviceModel,,,,"Sample Device Model Name"
{c22189e4-8bf3-4e6d-8467-8dc6d95e2a7e}, 2, 18,, "String value for property 1"
```
