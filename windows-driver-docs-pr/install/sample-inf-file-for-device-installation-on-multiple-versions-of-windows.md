# Sample INF File for Device Installation on Multiple Versions of Windows


The sample INF file (*MultiOS.inf*) shows how a single INF file can be used to install a device on multiple versions of Windows. As of March 2015, this sample is no longer available in the WDK.  It is still available as part of the [Windows 8 driver samples](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=616509) and the [Windows 8.1 driver samples](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=618052).
