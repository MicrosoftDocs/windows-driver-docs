# Interpreting HID Reports





This section describes how user-mode applications and kernel-mode drivers use the HidP\_*Xxx* [HIDClass support routines](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff538865) to interpret control data in a HID report.

For information about extracting control data from a report, see the following:
