# Handling HID Reports Topics


This section describes the mechanisms that user-mode applications and kernel-mode drivers use for handling [HID reports](introduction-to-hid-concepts.md).




After an application or driver has connected to a HID collection, it can obtain HID reports from, or send reports to, the collection. For more information about how to handle HID reports, see the following topics:
