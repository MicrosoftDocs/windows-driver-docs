# HIDClass Hardware IDs for Top-Level Collections


This section specifies the [hardware IDs](../install/hardware-ids.md) that the HID class driver generates for [top-level collections](top-level-collections.md).

Vendors must use the formats that are designated as *vendor hardware ID formats* to identify top-level collections. All other *device ID* formats are reserved for internal use only.

The hardware IDs that the HID class driver generates for a devnode depends on the following:

1.  Number of functions supported by the underlying transport
2.  Number of Top Level Collections in the Report Descriptor

Based on these factors, there are 4 categories of hardware IDs

|     Type        | Single TLC | Multiple TLC |
|-----------------|------------|--------------|
| Single-Function | Case 1     | Case 2       |
| Multi-Function  | Case 3     | Case 4       |

 

## Case 1: Single-function device with single TLC


Condition under which this Hardware ID format is used:

1.  Number of functions supported by the underlying transport = 1 &&
2.  Number of TLC = 1

Hardware ID Format:

-   HID\\Vid\_v(4)&Pid\_d(4)&Rev\_r(4)
-   HID\\Vid\_v(4)&Pid\_d(4)
-   HID\_DEVICE\_UP:p(4)\_U:u(4)
-   HID\_DEVICE

## Case 2: Single-function device with multiple TLC


Condition under which this Hardware ID format is used:

1.  Number of functions supported by the underlying transport = 1 &&
2.  Number of TLC > 1

Hardware ID Format:

-   HID\\Vid\_v(4)&Pid\_d(4)&Rev\_r(4)&Colb(2)
-   HID\\Vid\_v(4)&Pid\_d(4)&Colb(2)
-   HID\_DEVICE\_UP:p(4)\_U:u(4) \[RESERVED FOR WINDOWS INFs ONLY\]
-   HID\_DEVICE \[RESERVED FOR WINDOWS INFs ONLY\]

## Case 3: Multi-function device with single TLC


Condition under which this Hardware ID format is used:

1.  Number of functions supported by the underlying transport > 1 &&
2.  Number of TLC = 1

Hardware ID Format:

-   HID\\Vid\_v(4)&Pid\_d(4)&Rev\_r(4)&MI\_z(2)
-   HID\\Vid\_v(4)&Pid\_d(4)&MI\_z(2)
-   HID\_DEVICE\_UP:p(4)\_U:u(4) \[RESERVED FOR WINDOWS INFs ONLY\]
-   HID\_DEVICE \[RESERVED FOR WINDOWS INFs ONLY\]

## Case 4: Multi-function device with multiple TLC


Condition under which this Hardware ID format is used:

1.  Number of functions supported by the underlying transport > 1 &&
2.  Number of TLC > 1

Hardware ID Format:

-   HID\\Vid\_v(4)&Pid\_d(4)&Rev\_r(4)&MI\_z(2)&Colb(2)
-   HID\\Vid\_v(4)&Pid\_d(4)&MI\_z(2)&Colb(2)
-   HID\_DEVICE\_UP:p(4)\_U:u(4) \[RESERVED FOR WINDOWS INFs ONLY\]
-   HID\_DEVICE \[RESERVED FOR WINDOWS INFs ONLY\]

## Special purpose hardware ID


The following are hardware IDs (for internal use only) that Windows uses to provide default system functionality.

| Device Type            | Usage Page | Usage | Hardware ID                   |
|------------------------|:----------:|:-----:|-------------------------------|
| Pointer                | 0x01       | 0x01  | HID\_DEVICE\_SYSTEM\_MOUSE    |
| Mouse                  | 0x01       | 0x02  | HID\_DEVICE\_SYSTEM\_MOUSE    |
| Joystick               | 0x01       | 0x04  | HID\_DEVICE\_SYSTEM\_GAME     |
| Game pad               | 0x01       | 0x05  | HID\_DEVICE\_SYSTEM\_GAME     |
| Keyboard               | 0x01       | 0x06  | HID\_DEVICE\_SYSTEM\_KEYBOARD |
| Keypad                 | 0x01       | 0x07  | HID\_DEVICE\_SYSTEM\_KEYBOARD |
| System control         | 0x01       | 0x80  | HID\_DEVICE\_SYSTEM\_CONTROL  |
| Consumer audio control | 0x0C       | 0x01  | HID\_DEVICE\_SYSTEM\_CONSUMER |

Important notes:

-   There are no compatible IDs generated by HIDClass
-   Vendor 3rd party INFs must only match against the hardware IDs
-   Hardware IDs that contain HID\_DEVICE\_SYSTEM\_\* are “special” devices that the operating system opens for its use. Vendor provided INF must not match on these special hardware IDs.
-   Vendor provided 3rd party HID transport minidrivers must provided the fields listed below to ensure that HIDClass can generate the appropriate hardware IDs.
