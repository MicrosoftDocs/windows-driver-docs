# HID Collections Overview


A *HID collection* is a meaningful grouping of HID controls and their respective [HID usages](hid-usages.md).

Controls should be grouped together if they are logically related or are functionally dependent on one another. For instance, a SHIFT key and a letter key on a keyboard should not belong to separate collections. Collections can have nested *subcollections*, also referred to as [link collections](link-collections.md). Report descriptors define one or more [top-level collections](top-level-collections.md), and the report items, associated with each collection, define one or more HID reports.




Windows extends the concept of a HID collection to include the following:

[Top-level collections](top-level-collections.md)

[Top-level collections opened by Windows for system use](top-level-collections-opened-by-windows-for-system-use.md)

[Preparsed data](preparsed-data.md)

[Link collections](link-collections.md)

[Collection capability](collection-capability.md)

[Button capability arrays](button-capability-arrays.md)

[Value capability arrays](value-capability-arrays.md)

[Data indices](data-indices.md)
