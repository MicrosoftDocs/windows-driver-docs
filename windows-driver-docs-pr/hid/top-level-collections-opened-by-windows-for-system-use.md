*Multiple: Sensors usages from 0x00 â€“ 0xFF are segmented for different purposes. For example 0x10 indicates a biometric sensor; 0x40 indicates a light sensor. Those allocations are not contiguous. For the list of sensor usages, see [USB-IF Device Class Definitions for HID](https://www.usb.org/document-library/device-class-definition-hid-111). For information about sensors usages that are supported in Windows, [HID Sensors Usages](/windows-hardware/design/whitepapers/hid-sensors-usages).
