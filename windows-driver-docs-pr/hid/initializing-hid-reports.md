# Initializing HID Reports

This section describes how user-mode applications and kernel-mode drivers initialize a HID report before using the [HIDClass support routines](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/_hid) or the HID class driver IOCTLs.

To initialize a report buffer, an application or driver creates a zero-initialized buffer of the required size, in bytes, for the report type. The *Xxx*ReportByteLength members of a HID collection's [**HIDP\_CAPS**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/hidpi/ns-hidpi-_hidp_caps) structure specify the required size of input, output, and feature reports. After initializing a report buffer, an application or driver can use **HidP\_Set**_Xxx_ routines to set control data in the report. On the first use of a report, the **HidP\_Set**_Xxx_ routines set the report ID to the one associated with a specified [HID usage](hid-usages.md). If the application or driver subsequently attempts to set a usage that is incompatible with the report ID, the **HidP\_Set**_Xxx_ routines return a status of HIDP\_STATUS\_INCOMPATIBLE\_REPORT\_ID.
