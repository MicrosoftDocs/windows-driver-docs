> [!IMPORTANT]
> This topic is part of the [WiFiCx driver model](../netcx/wifi-wdf-class-extension-wificx.md). WiFiCx is the Wi-Fi driver model released in Windows 11. We recommend that you use WiFiCx to take advantage of the latest  features. The previous Wi-Fi driver model [WDI](../network/wdi-miniport-driver-design-guide.md) is in maintenance mode and will only receive high priority fixes.
