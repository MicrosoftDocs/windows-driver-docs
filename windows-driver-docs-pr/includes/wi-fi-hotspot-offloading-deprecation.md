## Wi-Fi Hotspot Offloading deprecation note

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Starting in Windows 10, version 1709, the Wi-Fi Hotspot Offloading feature is deprecated and should not be used. Instead, we recommend writing a UWP app and using the Wi-Fi Hotspot Authentication API (Windows.Networking.NetworkOperators).
>
> For a code sample and more info, see the [Wi-Fi hotspot authentication sample](/samples/browse/).
