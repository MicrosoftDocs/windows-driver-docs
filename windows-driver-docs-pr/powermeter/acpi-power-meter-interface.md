# ACPI Power Meter Interface


A WDM driver that provides the Power Meter Interface (PMI) accesses power metering and budgeting (PMB) information from the underlying hardware platform. The driver does this by using the ACPI PMI objects. The platform exposes this information by using the ACPI 4.0 Power Metering objects.

This section provides a high-level overview of the ACPI PMI.
