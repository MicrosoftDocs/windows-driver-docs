| Sample name | Build environment | Target operating system | PnP driver | In-box driver | Sample description |
|--|--|--|--|--|--|
| AVStream Filter-Centric Simulated Capture Driver (Avssamp) | Windows 8.1<br><br>Windows 8<br><br>Windows 7 | Windows 8.1<br><br>Windows 8<br><br>Windows 7 | No | No | Provides a filter-centric AVStream capture driver with functional audio. The driver performs captures at 320 x 240 resolution in RGB24 or YUV422 format while playing a user-provided pulse code modulation (PCM) wave audio file in a loop. The sample demonstrates how to write a filter-centric AVStream minidriver. |
| AVStream Simulated Hardware Sample Driver (Avshws) |Windows 8.1<br><br>Windows 8<br><br>Windows 7 | Windows 8.1<br><br>Windows 8<br><br>Windows 7| No | No | Provides a pin-centric AVStream capture driver for a simulated piece of hardware. The driver performs captures at 320 x 240 in either an RGB24 or YUV422 format through direct DMA into capture buffers.<br><br>The purpose of the sample is to demonstrate how to write a pin-centric AVStream minidriver. The sample also shows how to implement DMA by using the related functionality that AVStream provides.<br><br>This sample features enhanced parameter validation and overflow detection. |
