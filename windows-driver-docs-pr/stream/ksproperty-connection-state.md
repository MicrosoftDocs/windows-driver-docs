# KSPROPERTY_CONNECTION_STATE

The **KSPROPERTY_CONNECTION_STATE** property sets the current run state of the pin.

## Usage Summary Table

| Get | Set | Target | Property Descriptor Type | Property Value Type |
|--|--|--|--|--|
| No | Yes | Filter or Pin | [**KSPROPERTY**](./ksproperty-structure.md) | [**KSSTATE**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ks/ne-ks-ksstate) |

## Remarks

This property returns one of the following values:

| Value | Description |
|--|--|
| KSSTATE_STOP | The initial state of a pin. No data is actually being read or written. In this state, the pin uses the least amount of resources possible. |
| KSSTATE_ACQUIRE | The pin is acquiring the resources necessary to read or write data. |
| KSSTATE_PAUSE | The pin is ready to read or write data, but data transfer is temporarily paused. |
| KSSTATE_RUN | The state from which the pin can actually read or write data. |

The pin only reads or writes data in the **KSSTATE_RUN** state. Both individual pins and the KS filter as a whole may support this property.

## Requirements
