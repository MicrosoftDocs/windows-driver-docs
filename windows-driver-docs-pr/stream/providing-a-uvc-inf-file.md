# Providing a UVC INF File

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The content and sample code in this topic is outdated and currently unsupported. It may not work with the current driver development toolchain.

This section illustrates various portions of a device-specific INF file.

An INF file like this one could be used to provide a device-specific name or to register the Extension Unit plug-in.

In general, vendors who supply a setup package can register the plug-in DLL by using the setup package, in which case the vendor does not provide an INF file. For driver signing, it may be easier to provide a setup package instead of a device-specific INF file.

Be aware, however, that you must install this specific sample by using an INF file.

To do so, include the following code in the INF file, here arbitrarily named *Xuplgin.inf*:

```inf
; Copyright (c) CompanyName. All rights reserved.

[Version]
Signature="$Windows NT$"
Class=Camera
ClassGuid={ca3e7ab9-b4c3-4ae6-8251-579ef933890f}
Provider=%CompanyName%

[SourceDisksNames]
1=%Package%

[SourceDisksFiles]
MyPlugin.ax=1

[ControlFlags]
ExcludeFromSelect=*

[DestinationDirs]
MyDevice.CopyList=11    ; %systemroot%\system32 on NT-based systems

[Manufacturer]
%CompanyName%=CompanyName,NT$ARCH$
```

The device-specific INF file is matched with the device based on the VID/PID identifier. In this case, the device-specific INF file takes precedence over *Usbvideo.inf*.

```inf
[CompanyName.NT$ARCH$]
%MyDevice.DeviceDesc%=MyDevice,USB\Vid_XXXX&Pid_XXXX&MI_XX

[MyDevice]
Include=usbvideo.inf, ks.inf, kscaptur.inf
Needs=USBVideo.NT, KS.Registration, KSCAPTUR.Registration.NT
AddReg=MyDevice.Plugins
CopyFiles=MyDevice.CopyList
```

Additional sections of *Usbvideo.inf* need to be included for completeness.

```inf
[MyDevice.SERVICES]
Include=usbvideo.inf
Needs=USBVideo.NT.SERVICES

[MyDevice.HW]
Include=usbvideo.inf
Needs=USBVideo.NT.HW

[MyDevice.WDF]
Include=usbvideo.inf
Needs=USBVideo.NT.WDF

[WdmCompanionFilter_CompanionSect]
CompanionServices = SecureUSBVideo

[WdmCompanionFilter_KmdfSvcSect]
KmdfLibraryVersion = %KMDF_VERSION%

[SecureUSBVideo_UmdfSvcSect]
UmdfLibraryVersion = %UMDF_VERSION%
ServiceBinary = %12%\UMDF\SecureUSBVideo.dll
ServiceType = SecureCompanion ; allowed options are: Driver (default), SecureCompanion, NonSecureCompanion
TrustletIdentity = 4096          ; required if it is SecureCompanion
```

The INF also needs a CopyFiles section to copy the plug-in into the system folder.

```inf
[MyDevice.CopyList]
MyPlugin.ax
```

The first part of the following INF AddReg section registers the plug-in.  The remainder of this section shows the registry entries for a node-based Extension Unit plug-in. Refer to *Usbvideo.inf* for similar examples.

```inf
[MyDevice.PlugIns]
HKCR,CLSID\%Plugin.CLSID%,,,%PlugIn_IExtensionUnit%
HKCR,CLSID\%Plugin.CLSID%\InprocServer32,,,MyPlugin.ax
HKCR,CLSID\%Plugin.CLSID%\InprocServer32,ThreadingModel,,Both

; The IID is aggregated onto the node given the GUID of the property set
HKLM,System\CurrentControlSet\Control\NodeInterfaces\%XU_GUID%,,,
   %PlugIn_IExtensionUnit%
; IID in Little-Endian form
HKLM,System\CurrentControlSet\Control\NodeInterfaces\%XU_GUID%,IID,
   1,yy,yy,yy,yy,yy,yy,yy,yy,yy,yy,yy,yy,yy,yy,yy,yy
;CLSID in Little-Endian form
HKLM,System\CurrentControlSet\Control\NodeInterfaces\%XU_GUID%,
   CLSID,1,zz,zz,zz,zz,zz,zz,zz,zz,zz,zz,zz,zz,zz,zz,zz,zz
```

The following INF section shows how to populate interface-specific registry entries.

```inf
[MyDevice.Interfaces]
AddInterface=%KSCATEGORY_CAPTURE%,<Custom GUID/Global>,MyDevice.Interface
AddInterface=%KSCATEGORY_VIDEO_CAMERA%,<Custom GUID/Global>,MyDevice.Interface
AddInterface=%KSCATEGORY_VIDEO%,<Custom GUID/Global>,MyDevice.Interface

[MyDevice.Interface]
AddReg=MyDevice.Interface.AddReg
 
[MyDevice.Interface.AddReg]
HKR,,CLSID,,%ProxyVCap.CLSID%
HKR,,FriendlyName,,%MyDevice.DeviceDesc%
HKR,,RTCFlags,0x00010001,0x00000010
```

For USB Cameras, if the device interface registry key location contains a DWORD registry entry **EnableDependentStillPinCapture** with a non-zero value, the dependent pin on such cameras will be used for photo capture. If the registry entry is not present or set to zero, the dependent pin will not be used. Instead, the photo capture will be done using a frame taken from the preview pin.  The following enables dependent still pin capture:

```inf
HKR,,EnableDependentStillPinCapture,0x00010001,1
```

You can also define an optional registry value called **UvcFlags**. **UvcFlags** should be a DWORD value. When the device is plugged in, the UVC driver receives a Plug and Play (PnP) Start request. The driver then searches for **UvcFlags** in the device registry key. The DWORD value is a bitmask and can contain the values in the following table.

| Bitmask name | Value | Description |
|--|--|--|
| WORKAROUNDS_DV_INTERLEAVED_DEFAULT_MASK | 0x00000001 | UVC supports video-only data ranges and interleaved DV data ranges. Set this bitmask for interleaved DV. |
| WORKAROUNDS_SUPPRESS_CLOCK_MASK | 0x00000002 | Currently not used. |
| WORKAROUNDS_MPEG2TS_SUPPORT_FID | 0x00000004 | The FID mask indicates that the stream header contains an FID bit. |
| WORKAROUNDS_MPEG2TS_SUPPORT_EOF | 0x00000008 | The EOF mask indicates that the payload headers contain an end-of-frame bit. |
| WORKAROUNDS_VARIABLE_FRAME_RATE_MASK | 0x00000010 | Set this mask if your device might vary frame rate. Fixed-rate DV devices should not set this mask. |

Include a line similar to the following example to specify the bitmask to be applied:

```inf
HKR,,UvcFlags,0x00010001,0x00000010
```

If you are using the UVC driver on Windows Server 2003 and Windows Vista or later versions of the operating system, the FID and EOF masks can be used with stream-based formats such as MPEG-2 TS.

In low frame rate conditions, the EOF bit might report completion faster than the FID bit of the following frame. The EOF bit can be used to reduce latency in the delivery of MPEG-2 frames.

This final section supplies missing definitions for the INF.
