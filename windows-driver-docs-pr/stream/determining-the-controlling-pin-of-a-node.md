# Determining the Controlling Pin of a Node





Unlike filters and pins, nodes do not have an associated file handle by which applications in Ring 3 can access them. Because nodes are internal components within a filter, they exist somewhere between the filter's input and output pins. The network provider must determine which filter pin to use, then use the pin to access a node. This filter pin is called the controlling pin for that node. To determine the controlling pin for each node in the BDA template connection list of a filter, the network provider queries the KSPROPERTY\_BDA\_CONTROLLING\_PIN\_ID property of the [KSPROPSETID\_BdaTopology](./kspropsetid-bdatopology.md) property set. The BDA minidriver in turn calls the [**BdaPropertyGetControllingPinId**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/bdasup/nf-bdasup-bdapropertygetcontrollingpinid) support function for each node. In this call, the minidriver passes a pointer to a [**KSP\_BDA\_NODE\_PIN**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/bdamedia/ns-bdamedia-_ksp_bda_node_pin) structure. This structure identifies the property request to retrieve the controlling pin for a specific node type and a pair of the filter's input and output pins. The BDA support library returns the identifier of the controlling pin for the node type.

A BDA minidriver does not typically intercept the KSPROPERTY\_BDA\_CONTROLLING\_PIN\_ID property. The minidriver automatically dispatches the **BdaPropertyGetControllingPinId** support function from the KSPROPSETID\_BdaTopology property set. See [Determining BDA Device Topology](determining-bda-device-topology.md) for more information.

The support library is able to do all the work of determining the identifier of the controlling pin because the BDA minidriver provided the support library with a pointer to the [**BDA\_FILTER\_TEMPLATE**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/bdasup/ns-bdasup-_bda_filter_template) structure when the BDA minidriver started operating. See [Starting a BDA Minidriver](starting-a-bda-minidriver.md) for more information. A BDA minidriver informs the BDA support library how to determine controlling pins through information contained in BDA\_FILTER\_TEMPLATE. This information includes:

-   An array of connections. This array is a [**KSTOPOLOGY\_CONNECTION**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ks/ns-ks-kstopology_connection) array that provides a representation of all the possible connections between node and pin types that can be made within a filter or between a filter and adjoining filters. See [Mapping Connection Topology](mapping-connection-topology.md) For more information about the KSTOPOLOGY\_CONNECTION array.

-   An array of joint values. A joint is a point in the topology where one input splits into one or more paths to different outputs, or one or more inputs join into a single output path. The value given to a joint corresponds to the index of an element in the KSTOPOLOGY\_CONNECTION array. Most topologies will have only one joint.

-   An array of [**BDA\_PIN\_PAIRING**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/bdasup/ns-bdasup-_bda_pin_pairing) structures. These structures identify input and output pin types, the maximum number of input-type instances that can be created on the filter, and the maximum number of output-type instances that can be created on the filter. These structures also contain a pointer to the array of joint values between the input and output pins. See [Starting a BDA Minidriver](starting-a-bda-minidriver.md) For more information about the BDA\_PIN\_PAIRING array.
