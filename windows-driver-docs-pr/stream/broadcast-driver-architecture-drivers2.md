# Broadcast Driver Architecture Drivers


## <a href="" id="ddk-broadcast-driver-architecture-drivers-ksg"></a>


Broadcast Driver Architecture (BDA) drivers control hardware that manipulate a digital broadcast signal. The following sections describe how to design BDA drivers:

[Broadcast Receiver Topology](broadcast-receiver-topology.md)

[Broadcast Driver Architecture Minidrivers](broadcast-driver-architecture-minidrivers.md)

[Sample BDA Drivers](sample-bda-drivers.md)

[Building and Testing BDA Drivers](building-and-testing-bda-drivers.md)
