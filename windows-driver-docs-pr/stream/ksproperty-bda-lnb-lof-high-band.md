# KSPROPERTY_BDA_LNB_LOF_HIGH_BAND

Clients use **KSPROPERTY_BDA_LNB_LOF_HIGH_BAND** to inform the RF tuner node about the local oscillator frequency (LOF) that is used by the low-noise block (LNB) device for shifting the frequency of incoming high-band RF signals.

## Usage Summary Table

| Get | Set | Target | Property descriptor type | Property value type |
|--|--|--|--|--|
| Yes | Yes | Filter | KSP_NODE | ULONG |

## Remarks

The **NodeId** member of KSP_NODE specifies the identifier of the RF tuner node.

The property value specifies the LOF that is used by the LNB for high-band signals.

The LNB gathers the RF signal reflected by the satellite dish, shifts the frequency of the RF signal down by the high-band LOF amount, and sends the resulting signal to the RF tuner.

## Requirements
