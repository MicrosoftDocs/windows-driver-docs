# Common Control Nodes and Filters





The types of control nodes and filters that are shown in the figures in the [Control Nodes, Filters and Hardware](control-nodes--filters-and-hardware.md) section are common to the reception of digital satellite, terrestrial, and cable broadcasts. However, you can create other node types and filters for a wide variety of broadcast media and devices as well. It is important to remember that each control node need not correspond to a single BDA device filter. In some cases, a single BDA device filter can encapsulate more than one control node.

The following list describes control nodes and filters that are commonly found in Broadcast Architecture:

<a href="" id="network-provider"></a>**Network Provider**  
A *network provider filter* (or *network provider*) routes a digital television signal to and through BDA devices. A variety of broadcast providers currently transmit digital television signals over three basic network types--satellite, cable and antenna. These digital signals are transmitted in formats defined by multiple standards, including ATSC, DVB-S, DVB-C, and DVB-T. BDA devices receive and manage these digital signals.

A network provider:

-   is the source filter in a filter graph, although no data actually passes through it.

-   exists for each network type or can be created for a new network type.

-   participates in the graph building process.

-   communicates with other filters in the graph through property and method sets of BDA minidrivers that initialized such filters.

Each network provider can build a different graph configuration for its associated network type. Applications pass tune requests to a network provider, which in turn passes the information to a BDA minidriver. See the Broadcast Architecture section of the Microsoft Windows SDK documentation for more information.

<a href="" id="tuner"></a>**Tuner**  
This control node filters the particular frequency that carries the transport stream. It can appear inside a filter by itself or together with other control nodes.

<a href="" id="demodulator"></a>**Demodulator**  
A control node that translates the analog signal into a digital bit stream. It can appear inside a filter by itself or together with other control nodes.

<a href="" id="capture"></a>**Capture**  
A filter that moves the data into host memory.

<a href="" id="pid-filter"></a>**PID Filter**  
A control node that selects one or more elementary data streams from the transport stream. This is the primary function of a demultiplexer. It can appear inside a filter by itself or together with other control nodes.

<a href="" id="mpe-parser"></a>**MPE Parser**  
A filter that parses IP data from a stream containing MPEG-2 private sections.

<a href="" id="ipsink"></a>**IPSink**  
A filter that accepts IP packets as data samples and forwards the data to the NDIS TCP/IP stack.

<a href="" id="ndisip"></a>**NDISIP**  
An NDIS miniport driver that acts as a receiver for a network adapter for the data that the IPSink filter passes.

**Note**   Starting with Windows Vista, the IPSink filter is not supported.
