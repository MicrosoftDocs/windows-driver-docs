# AV/C Driver Stacks





As AV/C devices are added to and removed from the IEEE 1394 bus, the Plug and Play manager loads and unloads the corresponding subunit drivers. Vendors implement unique AV/C subunit functionality by writing a subunit driver that Windows loads onto the IEEE 1394 stack above *Avc.sys*. *Avc.sys* uses functionality provided by the underlying IEEE 1394 and IEC-61883 drivers to control devices and to connect and manage plugs. For more information about these underlying driver stacks, see [The IEEE 1394 Driver Stack](../ieee/the-ieee-1394-driver-stack.md) and [IEC-61883 Client Drivers](../ieee/iec-61883-client-drivers.md).

The peer driver stack is for subunits on external AV/C devices. In contrast, the virtual driver stack is a separate driver stack that exposes the computer as an AV/C device to other AV/C devices that are connected on the IEEE 1394 bus. The following diagram demonstrates the two different *Avc.sys* stacks.

At the base of the driver stacks are *1394ohci.sys* and *1394bus.sys*. These drivers provide the basic IEEE 1394 bus infrastructure support. There are instances of these drivers for each physical IEEE 1394 adapter in the system.

Stacked above *1394ohci.sys* and *1394bus.sys* is *61883.sys*. There is an instance of *61883.sys* for each IEC-61883-enabled node on the IEEE 1394 bus. The driver's *61883.sys* provides the following support for the IEC 61883 protocol:

-   Connection Management Protocol (CMP) IEC 61883-1

-   Common Isochronous Packet (CIP) IEC 61883-1

-   Function Control Protocol (FCP) IEC 61883-1

Stacked above *61883.sys* is *Avc.sys*, which supports the AV/C protocol, the Plug and Play enumeration of active subunits on each AV/C device, and AV/C subunit plug connection management and control. For more information about plug connection and format management, see [AV/C Subunit Plug Connection and Format Management](av-c-subunit-plug-connection-and-format-management.md).

Subunit drivers are stacked above *Avc.sys*. This is the layer where vendors implement the functionality that is unique to their AV/C subunit. Generally, for every physical instance of an AV/C subunit, there is a corresponding instance of that subunit's driver. That is, each device identifier (ID) is represented by an instance of *Avc.sys*. However, *Avc.sys* permits this behavior to be overridden based on the ***Vendor*** and/or ***Model*** fields of the device identifier of the AV/C unit. For more information about the ***Vendor***, ***Model***, ***SubunitType***, and ***SubunitID*** fields of device identifier strings generated by *Avc.sys* see [AV/C Device IDs](av-c-device-identifiers.md).
