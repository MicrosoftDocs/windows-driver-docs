# Control Nodes, Filters and Hardware





BDA control nodes in BDA receiver topology can be separated into individual filters or combined in filters. In addition, BDA control nodes can be associated with hardware or be software-only components. The following sections describe:

[Control Nodes](control-nodes.md)

[Combining Nodes in a Filter](combining-nodes-in-a-filter.md)

[Separating Nodes in Individual Filters](separating-nodes-in-individual-filters.md)

[Control Nodes for Processing IP Data](control-nodes-for-processing-ip-data.md)
