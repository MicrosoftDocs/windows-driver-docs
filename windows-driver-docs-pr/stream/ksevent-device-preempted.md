## Remarks

A preemption event is triggered in the following scenario.

1. Initially only one camera is attached to the system, and a Windows app is streaming video from the camera.

1. A second Windows app requests that the capture stack preempt the device from the first app and give control to the second app.

1. When this request is issued, the driver sends the **KSEVENT_DEVICE_PREEMPTED** event to both Windows apps.
