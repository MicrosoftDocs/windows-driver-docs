# Separating Nodes in Individual Filters





The following figure of a sample DirectShow filter graph shows another way in which the control nodes can be represented as filters in a filter graph. In this sample, the tuner and demodulator control nodes are separated into individual filters. All other control nodes are as described in the [Combining Nodes in a Filter](combining-nodes-in-a-filter.md) section.
