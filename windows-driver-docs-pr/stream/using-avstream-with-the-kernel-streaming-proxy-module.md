# Using AVStream with the Kernel Streaming Proxy Module





Kernel-mode filters often are connected in user mode through the [Kernel Streaming Proxy](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/_stream/index). This proxy makes a kernel-mode filter appear to user mode as a DirectShow filter.

When this mode of connection is used, DirectShow connects the filters by intersecting their *media types*. These media types are the DirectShow counterpart to data formats in kernel mode.

When DirectShow enumerates a media type on a kernel-mode pin, the corresponding data range on the pin is intersected with the pin's data range. This intersection yields a data format, as described in [Data Range Intersections in AVStream](data-range-intersections-in-avstream.md). The proxy converts the resulting data format into a DirectShow media type.

As in kernel mode, the proxy either asks a data handler to determine whether the media type is acceptable, or it determines whether the media type is a partial match for a data range on the pin. A partial match indicates that, in the context of kernel-mode semantics, the major type, subformat, specifier, and required attributes match. If the media type is a partial match, the connection proceeds.

Before the connection is complete, AVStream calls the minidriver's [*AVStrMiniPinSetDataFormat*](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ks/nc-ks-pfnkspinsetdataformat) dispatch to inform the minidriver of the data format being set. This format corresponds to the user-mode media type that was suggested to the proxied pin. AVStream also provides the data range that was determined to be a partial match for the format.
