# DVD Data Streams





DVD decoder minidrivers support both input and output data streams. Streams are uniquely defined by three GUIDs (major type, minor type, and specifier) and a format block. Stream formats are also referred to as media types. For more information about format blocks and media types, see DirectShow in the Microsoft Windows SDK documentation

The following stream-related topics are discussed:

[Input Streams](input-streams.md)

[Output Streams](output-streams.md)

[Stream Changes](stream-changes.md)

[Stream Synchronization](stream-synchronization.md)

[Closed Captioning Streams](closed-captioning-streams.md)

[Multiple Data Streams on the same Hardware](multiple-data-streams-on-the-same-hardware.md)
