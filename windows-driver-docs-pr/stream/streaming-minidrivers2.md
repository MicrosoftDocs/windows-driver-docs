# Streaming Minidrivers





**Note**   This section details the outdated *Stream.sys* class driver. With the release of Microsoft Windows XP, Microsoft supports *Stream.sys* only for existing drivers. As of this release, Microsoft recommends that vendors consider developing new video or audio/video multimedia drivers using the AVStream class driver model. See details in the [AVStream Overview](avstream-overview.md). If developing an audio-only driver, you should write an audio miniport driver under the Microsoft-provided *Portcls.sys* class driver. For details, see [Audio Miniport Drivers](../audio/audio-miniport-drivers.md).

 

Vendors can support video-only or audio/video devices by providing a minidriver that runs under the Microsoft-provided *Stream.sys* class driver. In this documentation, vendor-provided minidrivers under *Stream.sys* are referred to as *streaming minidrivers*.

For instance, video capture devices and DVD players can be supported with streaming minidrivers. For technology-specific information, see [Video Capture Devices](video-capture-devices.md) and [DVD Decoder Minidrivers](dvd-decoder-minidrivers2.md).

Streaming minidrivers support kernel streaming semantics. To use this document, driver developers should be familiar with basic kernel streaming concepts, as explained in [Kernel Streaming](kernel-streaming.md).

The stream class driver is designed to make writing hardware drivers for streaming devices simpler by handling many of the aspects of interacting with the operating system.

-   The minidriver can allow the stream class driver to handle synchronization on its behalf. For example, the stream class driver can optionally serialize I/O requests for the minidriver. Allowing the class driver to handle synchronization makes the minidriver multiprocessor-safe but nonreentrant. This is suitable for low-end to medium-end hardware.

-   The class driver automatically synchronizes file operations. For example, the opening of a stream and a device are correctly serialized without the minidriver using mutexes, semaphores, or events.

-   The class driver abstracts the implementation of kernel streaming semantics from the minidriver.

-   The class driver handles all interaction with the PnP manager. For example:
    -   The class driver creates the functional device object on the minidriver's behalf.
    -   The class driver manages resource configuration (such as translating port addresses, translating and mapping memory ranges, and connecting interrupts).
    -   The class driver handles PnP IRPs, such as [**IRP\_MN\_START\_DEVICE**](../kernel/irp-mn-start-device.md), or [**IRP\_MN\_STOP\_DEVICE**](../kernel/irp-mn-stop-device.md).
-   All low-level buffer management is handled by the class driver:
    -   Allocating DMA adapter object, if necessary.
    -   Mapping buffers and building scatter/gather lists for DMA.
    -   Locking and flushing buffers correctly for both DMA and PIO.
-   All IOCTL parameter validation is performed by the class driver.

-   All requests are timed by the class driver with a watchdog timer.

-   The minidriver does not create a device object, but shares the class driver's device object as necessary. This saves system resources.

-   Only one device object is created per adapter. Multiple subdevices (called *streams*) supported by the adapter are represented by kernel streaming pins.
