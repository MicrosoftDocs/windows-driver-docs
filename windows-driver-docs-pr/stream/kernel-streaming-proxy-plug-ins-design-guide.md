# Kernel Streaming Proxy Plug-ins Design Guide


The kernel-streaming (KS) proxy module (*Ksproxy.ax*) is a DirectShow filter that brokers communication between KS objects in kernel-mode and user-mode applications. User-mode components can use KS proxy to communicate with any minidriver that is based on *Ks.sys*.

Specifically, an application can use the KS proxy module to control and retrieve information from KS objects that a KS minidriver implements. KS objects include, for example, KS filters, KS pins, and KS clocks.

You can extend KS proxy by writing a plug-in, which is a COM interface that provides methods to access property values. An advantage of the plug-in model is that it provides application writers with a mechanism that is more familiar than working directly with KS pin and KS filter property sets.

The following sections provide a high-level description of how to write an interface handler plug-in or a property page that uses KS proxy to communicate with a KS-based minidriver.

The interface plug-in provides programmatic control to get and set property values from within an application. Alternatively, if your goal is to enable users to manipulate properties through a user interface, a property page makes more sense. Both mechanisms require that you update the registry.
