# Broadcast Receiver Topology





A *Broadcast Driver Architecture (BDA) receiver topology* is an abstract representation of a filter graph. It is composed of a network of logical nodes, each of which performs an operation on a signal. Each node can be associated with an individual filter or combined with other nodes in a filter. The following sections discuss BDA receiver topology:

[Functional Topology](functional-topology.md)

[Control Nodes, Filters and Hardware](control-nodes--filters-and-hardware.md)

[Common Control Nodes and Filters](common-control-nodes-and-filters.md)
