# Universal camera driver functions for Windows 10

The camera driver interface for Windows 10 is converged for all devices and uses a universal camera driver model.

The following topics provide information about universal camera driver functions for Windows 10:

| Title | Description |
|--|--|
| [KsAcquireCachedMdl](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ks/nf-ks-ksacquirecachedmdl) | This function is used to acquire the MDL cached by the KS port driver. The function is used by a kernel mode driver to acquire the MDL for a pipeline-supplied sample generated by an Avstream driver. |
| [KsDeviceRegisterThermalDispatch](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ks/nf-ks-ksdeviceregisterthermaldispatch) | This function is used by the Avstream miniport driver to register callbacks for thermal notifications with the KS port driver. |
| [KsGenerateThermalEvent](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ks/nf-ks-ksgeneratethermalevent) | This function is used by clients (miniport drivers) that do not want to subscribe to the thermal manager, but want to do their own thermal management. |
| [KsInitializeDeviceProfile](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ks/nf-ks-ksinitializedeviceprofile) | The KsInitializeDeviceProfile API must be called by all miniport drivers to initialize the profile store and publish the device profiles. |
| [KsPersistDeviceProfile](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ks/nf-ks-kspersistdeviceprofile) | The KsPersistDeviceProfile API commits the profile information to the persistent store. |
| [KsPublishDeviceProfile](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ks/nf-ks-kspublishdeviceprofile) | The KsPublishDeviceProfile API is called to publish device profile information. |
| [KsReleaseCachedMdl](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ks/nf-ks-ksreleasecachedmdl) | The KsReleaseCachedMdl function is used to release the MDL acquired by the KsAcquireCachedMdl call. |
