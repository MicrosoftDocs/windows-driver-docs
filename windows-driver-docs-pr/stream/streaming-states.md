# Streaming States


Each stream provided by the minidriver exists in one of four states: KSSTATE\_STOP, KSSTATE\_ACQUIRE, KSSTATE\_PAUSE, or KSSTATE\_RUN. Upon initialization, the stream is, by default, in the **KSSTATE\_STOP** state. Transitions to the other states are made when the Stream class interface sends an [**SRB\_SET\_STREAM\_STATE**](./srb-set-stream-state.md) request to the minidriver. The following table identifies and describes the four stream states.

<tr class="odd">
<td><p>KSSTATE_STOP</p></td>
<td><p>When the stream state is stopped, the minidriver uses the absolute minimum of resources, and there are no outstanding data SRBs in the minidriver's queue.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>KSSTATE_ACQUIRE</p></td>
<td><p>When the stream state is acquiring resources, the minidriver allocates all needed resources, such as bandwidth on USB and IEEE 1394.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>KSSTATE_PAUSE</p></td>
<td><p>When the stream state is paused, the minidriver is prepared to instantly make a transition to KSSTATE_RUN.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>KSSTATE_RUN</p></td>
<td><p>When the stream state is streaming, the minidriver fills buffers and completes SRBs using <strong>CompleteStreamSRB</strong>.</p></td>
</tr>
