# Time Stamps


Minidrivers should time stamp data packets to synchronize multiple data streams. Kernel-mode clocks begin counting time when they first transition out of the **KSSTATE\_STOP** state. Thereafter, clocks should increment time stamps in regular intervals of 100 nanosecond units until the stream transitions to the **KSSTATE\_STOP** state.

Each data packet that is transferred corresponds to a single frame or field of video or ancillary data. Video capture driver writers that are concerned with frame-accurate video capture can choose to provide a clock that all other filters can use as a reference. Digital video minidrivers are an example of minidrivers that should provide clocks to use in a filter graph. Alternatively, video capture minidrivers that run asynchronously to other multimedia streams, such as USB and IEEE 1394 conferencing cameras, should time stamp their data packets with a clock provided by another component, such as an audio digitizer.

If a Stream class minidriver provides master clock, it should specify the following values in the [**HW\_STREAM\_OBJECT**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/strmini/ns-strmini-_hw_stream_object) structure:

```cpp
PHW_STREAM_OBJECT *pStreamObject;
 
PStreamObject->HWClockFunction = (PHW_CLOCK_FUNCTION)StreamClockRoutine;
PStreamObject->ClockSupportFlags = CLOCK_SUPPORT_CAN_READ_ONBOARD_CLOCK | CLOCK_SUPPORT_CAN_RETURN_STREAM_TIME;
```
