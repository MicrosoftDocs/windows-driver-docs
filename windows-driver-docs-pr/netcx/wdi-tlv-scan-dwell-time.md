## Values


| Type   | Description                                                                                                                                                                           |

| UINT32 | Specifies the maximum time in milliseconds to dwell on active channels. This is a hint and if the adapter decides to use its own dwell time, it must meet the Maximum Scan Time requirement. If overridden, the adapter must also meet the low latency connection quality parameters. |
| UINT32 | Specifies the maximum time in milliseconds to dwell on passive channels. This is a hint and if the adapter decides to use its own dwell time, it must meet the Maximum Scan Time requirement. If overridden, the adapter must also meet the low latency connection quality parameters.|
| UINT32 | Specifies the maximum time in milliseconds for total scan. If the adapter limits its dwell times to below the values specified above, it can ignore the Maximum Scan Time parameter.          |
