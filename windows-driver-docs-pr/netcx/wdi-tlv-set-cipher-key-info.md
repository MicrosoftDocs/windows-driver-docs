# WDI\_TLV\_SET\_CIPHER\_KEY\_INFO (dot11wificxtypes.hpp)

[!INCLUDE [WiFiCx topic note](../includes/wificx-version-warning.md)]

WDI\_TLV\_SET\_CIPHER\_KEY\_INFO is a TLV that contains cipher key mapping key information for [OID\_WDI\_SET\_ADD\_CIPHER\_KEYS](./oid-wdi-set-add-cipher-keys.md).

## TLV Type

0x52

## Length

The sum (in bytes) of the sizes of all contained TLVs.

## Values

| Type| Multiple TLV instances allowed | Optional | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [**WDI\_TLV\_PEER\_MAC\_ADDRESS**](wdi-tlv-peer-mac-address.md) | | X | Specifies the MAC address of the peer that this key is associated with. If not present, assume this is a default key. At least one of peer MAC Address or cipher key ID must be present. This field must be present when key type is set to WDI\_CIPHER\_KEY\_TYPE\_PAIRWISE\_KEY, and may be present when key type is set to WDI\_CIPHER\_KEY\_TYPE\_GROUP\_KEY. |
| [**WDI\_TLV\_CIPHER\_KEY\_ID**](wdi-tlv-cipher-key-id.md) | | X | Specifies the ID for this cipher key. At least one of peer MAC address or cipher key ID must be present. This field is not required for pairwise keys. |
| [**WDI\_TLV\_CIPHER\_KEY\_TYPE\_INFO**](wdi-tlv-cipher-key-type-info.md) | | | Specifies the cipher key type information. |
| [**WDI\_TLV\_CIPHER\_KEY\_RECEIVE\_SEQUENCE\_COUNT**](wdi-tlv-cipher-key-receive-sequence-count.md) | | X | Specifies the initial 48-bit value of Packet Number (PN), which is used for replay protection. This is optional if the cipher algorithm is WDI\_CIPHER\_ALGO\_WEP40, WDI\_CIPHER\_ALGO\_WEP104, or WDI\_CIPHER\_ALGO\_WEP. |
| [**WDI\_TLV\_CIPHER\_KEY\_CCMP\_KEY**](wdi-tlv-cipher-key-ccmp-key.md) | | X | Specifies the CCMP cipher algorithm key data. This is only present if the cipher algorithm is WDI\_CIPHER\_ALGO\_CCMP. |
| [**WDI_TLV_CIPHER_KEY_GCMP_256_KEY**](wdi-tlv-cipher-key-gcmp-256-key.md) | | X | Contains GCMP\_256 cipher algorithm key data. This is only present if the cipher algorithm is WDI\_CIPHER\_ALGO\_GCMP\_256. |
| [**WDI\_TLV\_CIPHER\_KEY\_TKIP\_INFO**](wdi-tlv-cipher-key-tkip-info.md) | | X | Specifies the TKIP information. This is only present if the cipher algorithm is WDI\_CIPHER\_ALGO\_TKIP. |
| [**WDI\_TLV\_CIPHER\_KEY\_BIP\_KEY**](wdi-tlv-cipher-key-bip-key.md) | | X | Specifies the BIP key. This is only present if the cipher algorithm is WDI\_CIPHER\_ALGO\_BIP. |
| [**WDI_TLV_CIPHER_KEY_BIP_GMAC_256_KEY**](wdi-tlv-cipher-key-bip-gmac-256-key.md) | | X | Contains GMAC\_256 cipher algorithm key data. This is only present if cipher algorithm is WDI\_CIPHER\_ALGO\_BIP\_GMAC\_256. |
| [**WDI\_TLV\_CIPHER\_KEY\_WEP\_KEY**](wdi-tlv-cipher-key-wep-key.md) | | X | Specifies the WEP key. This is only present if the cipher algorithm is WDI\_CIPHER\_ALGO\_WEP40, WDI\_CIPHER\_ALGO\_WEP104, or WDI\_CIPHER\_ALGO\_WEP |
| [**WDI\_TLV\_CIPHER\_KEY\_IHV\_KEY**](wdi-tlv-cipher-key-ihv-key.md) | | X | Specifies the IHV cipher key. This is only present if [**WDI\_TLV\_CIPHER\_KEY\_TYPE\_INFO**](wdi-tlv-cipher-key-type-info.md) is in the range WDI\_CIPHER\_ALGO\_IHV\_START to WDI\_CIPHER\_ALGO\_IHV\_END. |
