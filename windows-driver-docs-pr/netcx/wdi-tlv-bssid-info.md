| UINT8 | AP reachability. Valid values are 1 (not reachable), 2 (unknown), and 3 (reachable).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| UINT8 | Security. If this is set to 1, it indicates that the AP identified by this BSSID supports the same security provisioning as used by the STA in its current association. If this is set to 0, it indicates that either this AP does not support the same security provisioning, or the security information is not available at this time. |
| UINT8 | Key scope bit. If it is set to 1, it indicates the AP indicated by this BSSID has the same authenticator as the AP sending the report. If this bit is set to 0, it indicates a distinct authenticator or the information is not available.                                                                                                |
| UINT8 | This is set to 1 if dot11SpectrumManagementRequired is true.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| UINT8 | This is set to 1 if dot11QosOptionImplemented is true.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| UINT8 | An AP sets the APSD subfield to 1 within the Capability Information field when dot11APSDOptionImplemented is true, and sets it to 0 otherwise.                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| UINT8 | This is set to 1 if the AP represented by this BSSID includes an MDE in its Beacon frames.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| UINT8 | This is set to 1 to indicate that the AP represented by this BSSID is an HT AP, including the HT Capabilities element in its Beacon.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
