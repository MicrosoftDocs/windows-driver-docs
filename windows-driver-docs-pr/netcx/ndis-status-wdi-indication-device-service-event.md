# NDIS_STATUS_WDI_INDICATION_DEVICE_SERVICE_EVENT (dot11wificxintf.h)

[!INCLUDE [WiFiCx topic note](../includes/wificx-version-warning.md)]

WiFiCx drivers use the NDIS_STATUS_WDI_INDICATION_DEVICE_SERVICE_EVENT status indication to pass on unsolicited information about a device to a user mode client.

Device service indications must be sent by the driver only when in the *D0* power state, and it must not cause the device to wake from *Dx*. WDI will drop this indication without forwarding it up the stack if it receives it when in *Dx*.

This indication is currently handled only on the default port (station).

The driver should send a separate notification for every device service GUID and opcode pair whenever necessary.

## Payload data
