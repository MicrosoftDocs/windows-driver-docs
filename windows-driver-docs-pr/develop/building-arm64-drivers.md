# Building Arm64 Drivers with the WDK

Windows 10 can run on machines that are powered by Arm64 processors.  However, because Windows 10 on Arm does not support emulation of x86 kernel-mode or UMDF drivers, you must recompile these drivers to Arm64 using the instructions below.

## Setup

1. Download [Visual Studio 2017 or 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/).  You'll need at minimum version 15.9.
2. On the Windows start menu, type **Visual Studio Installer**.  Then on the **Workloads** tab, select **Desktop development with C++**.

2. On the **Individual Components** tab, select the following options:

    * MSVC v142 - VS 2019 C++ ARM build tools (latest)
    * MSVC v142 - VS 2019 C++ ARM64 build tools (latest)
    * C++ ATL for latest v142 build tools (ARM)
    * C++ ATL for latest v142 build tools (ARM64)
    * C++ MFC for latest v142 build tools (ARM)
    * C++ MFC for latest v142 build tools (ARM64)

3.	Install and restart Visual Studio.
4.  Download the [Windows SDK](https://developer.microsoft.com/windows/downloads/windows-sdk).  Ensure that you have SDK version 16299 (Windows 10, version 1709) or later.
5.	Download the [WDK](../download-the-wdk.md).  Ensure that you have WDK version 16299 or later.

## Building an Arm64 Driver with the WDK

1.	In Visual Studio, open a driver solution.  You can use your own, or one from the [Windows-driver-samples](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-driver-samples) repo.
2.	Select Solutions platform and select **Configuration Manager**.

4.	From **Type or Select new Platform**, select **Arm64**.  Copy settings from **Win32**.  Select **OK** and **Close**.
