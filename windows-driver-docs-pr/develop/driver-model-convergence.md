# Driver convergence model for Windows 10

To make your device work on Windows and Windows Phone releases before Windows 10, you probably needed to write two separate drivers, for example one for Windows 8.1 and one for Windows Phone 8.1. In Windows 10, in most cases, you can write one driver that will run on any Windows 10 version. This topic describes convergence plans for device driver interfaces in Windows 10 and provides details when there are version-specific differences. It answers these questions:

-   For legacy drivers, will a Windows 8.1 driver work on Windows 10 for desktop editions (Home, Pro, and Enterprise) and/or Windows 10 Mobile?
-   For new drivers, can I build one driver with the Windows 10 kit that will work on Windows 10 for desktop editions and Windows 10 Mobile?

<td align="left">Yes</td>
<td align="left"><p>Starting in Windows 10, you can write a Kernel-Mode Driver Framework (KMDF) audio driver that calls KMDF interfaces for PnP, power management, and idle management. For I/O handling, a KMDF audio driver should not use the I/O queue functionality in WDF, but should instead use the existing COM interfaces provided by PortClass. However, your driver can use the framework's support for timers, interrupts, DMA, and remote I/O targets. KMDF audio drivers work on both Windows 10 for desktop editions and Windows 10 Mobile.</p>
<p>Existing Windows 8.1 drivers that link to PortClass continue to work on Windows 10 for desktop editions and Windows 10 Mobile.</p></td>

<p>The Bluetooth audio driver surface area is diverged for Windows 10 and allows the following two options:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can write a new universal audio driver that works for both desktop and mobile devices.</li>
<li>An existing Windows Phone 8.1 Bluetooth audio driver will run on Windows 10 Mobile.</li>

<p>Equivalent cellular and wi-fi connection management using converged stack. Mobile operators can use Open Mobile Alliance Device Management (OMA DM) configuration of cellular settings in both Windows 10 for desktop editions and Windows 10 Mobile. Also, OEMs will have access to Multivariant provisioning in both Windows 10 for desktop editions and Windows 10 Mobile, while the Mobile Broadband Account Experience (MBAE) will still be available in Windows 10 for desktop editions.</p></td>

<p>Windows 8.1 sensor class extension uses UMDF 1. Windows Phone 8.1 sensor class extension uses UMDF 2. For Windows 10, new sensor class extension uses UMDF 2 like Windows Phone 8.1. To build using Windows 10 kit, must use latter. Driver binary from Windows 8.1 still runs on Windows 10.
