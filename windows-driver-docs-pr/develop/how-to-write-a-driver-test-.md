# How to write a driver test using a Driver Test template

> [!NOTE]
> This topic describes functionality that is only available in Visual Studio 2013. For info on previous WDK and Visual Studio editions, see [Other WDK downloads](../other-wdk-downloads.md).

You can use the Windows Driver Kit (WDK) for Windows 8 to create your own driver tests or to customize some of the tests that are provided. You can deploy the tests that you create to remote test computers using the driver testing framework that the WDK provides for Microsoft Visual Studio Ultimate 2012.

The WDK provides templates that create starter code for a Windows Driver test project in C++, C\#, and Script (JScript). You can select the test cases that you want to include, or you can start with a blank project. You can customize the code to add new test cases for your driver. You can deploy your tests from Visual Studio using the driver test framework.

1.  From the **File** menu, select **New &gt; Project**.
2.  From the list of installed templates in the **New Project** dialog box, select **Visual C++ &gt; Windows Driver &gt; Tests**.
3.  Select **Windows Driver Test in C++**.
4.  Provide a name for your driver test project and a location (or use the default).
5.  From the **Windows Driver Test** dialog box, select the test cases that you want to include or choose an empty (blank) driver test. For more information about the test cases, see [Windows Driver test cases](#windows_driver_test_cases).
6.  Add the required test metadata. For more information, see [How to add test metadata](to-add-test-metadata.md).
7.  Build your driver test.

When you build your driver test, the new test will be available for deployment to a test computer. By default, the tests that you create will appear in the test category **My Test Category**. The names of the tests are based upon the test cases that you choose, and they will have names such as **My Plug and Play Surprise Remove Test**. During each build of the test, the test will be overwritten. The latest build of the test will be available to deploy and run on the test computer.

The WDK provides starter code for a Windows Driver test project in C++, C\#, and Script. You can select test cases that you want to include, or you can start with a blank project. Not all test cases are available in every language.
