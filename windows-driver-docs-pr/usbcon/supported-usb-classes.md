# USB device class drivers included in Windows

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This topic is for programmers. If you are a customer experiencing USB problems, see [Troubleshoot common USB problems](https://support.microsoft.com/help/17614/windows-10-troubleshoot-common-usb-problems)

This article lists the Microsoft-provided drivers for the supported USB device classes.

- Microsoft-provided drivers for USB-IF approved device classes.
- For composite devices, use [USB Generic Parent Driver (Usbccgp.sys)](usb-common-class-generic-parent-driver.md) that creates physical device objects (PDOs) for each function.
- For non-composite devices or a function of a composite device, use [WinUSB (Winusb.sys)](winusb.md).

**If you are installing USB drivers:** You don't need to download USB device class drivers. They're installed automatically. These drivers and their installation files are included in Windows. They're available in the \\Windows\\System32\\DriverStore\\FileRepository folder. The drivers are updated through Windows Update.

**If you are writing a custom driver:** Before writing a driver for your USB device, determine whether a Microsoft-provided driver meets the device requirements. If a Microsoft-provided driver isn't available for the USB device class to which your device belongs, then consider using generic drivers, Winusb.sys or Usbccgp.sys. Write a driver only when necessary. More guidelines are included in [Choosing a driver model for developing a USB client driver](winusb-considerations.md).

## USB device classes

*USB device classes* are categories of devices with similar characteristics and that perform common functions. The USB-IF defines those classes and their specifications. Each device class is identified by a USB-IF approved class, subclass, and protocol codes, all of which are provided by the IHV in device descriptors in the firmware. Microsoft provides in-box drivers for several of those device classes, called *USB device class drivers*. If a device that belongs to a supported device class is connected to a system, Windows automatically loads the class driver, and the device functions with no other driver required.

Hardware vendors shouldn't write drivers for the supported device classes. Windows class drivers might not support all of the features that are described in a class specification. If some of the device's capabilities aren't implemented by the class driver, vendors should provide supplementary drivers that work with the class driver to support the entire range of functionality provided by the device.

For general information about USB-IF approved device classes see the [USB Common Class Specification](https://usb.org/sites/default/files/usbccs10.pdf)

The current list of USB class specifications and class codes is documented in the [USB-IF Defined Class Code List](https://www.usb.org/defined-class-codes).

## Device setup classes

Windows categorizes devices by *device setup classes*, which indicate the functionality of the device.

Microsoft defines setup classes for most devices. IHVs and OEMs can define new device setup classes, but only if none of the existing classes apply. For more information, see [System-Defined Device Setup Classes](../install/system-defined-device-setup-classes-reserved-for-system-use.md).

Two important device setup classes for USB devices are as follows:

- **USBDevice** {88BAE032-5A81-49f0-BC3D-A4FF138216D6}: IHVs must use this class for custom devices that don't belong to another class. This class isn't used for USB host controllers and hubs.

- **USB** {36fc9e60-c465-11cf-8056-444553540000}: IHVs must not use this class for their custom devices. This is reserved for USB host controllers and USB hubs.

The device setup classes are different from USB device classes discussed earlier. For example, an audio device has a USB device class code of 01h in its descriptor. When connected to a system, Windows loads the Microsoft-provided class driver, *Usbaudio.sys*. In Device Manager, the device is shown under is **Sound, video and game controllers**, which indicates that the device setup class is Media.
