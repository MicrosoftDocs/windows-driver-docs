# USB XHCIWMI

XHCIWMI is a tool for diagnostic purposes. This tool only runs on Windows 8 and gathers information when the device is attached to an xHCI port and Windows loads the Microsoft USB 3.0 driver stack.

## XHCIWMI

Run the following command in an elevated Command Prompt window:

```cmd
Xhciwmi.exe
```

The tool shows the current firmware revision and information about the controller in the command window. Run the following command to verify the firmware of the controller and hub against known issues:

```cmd
Xhciwmi.exe –verify
```

We recommend using the **–verify** option for checking the controller and the connected hubs.
