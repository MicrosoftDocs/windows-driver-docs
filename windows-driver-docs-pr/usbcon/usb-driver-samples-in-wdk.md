<td><p>The OSRUSBFX2 sample shows how to perform bulk and interrupt data transfers to a Universal Serial Bus (USB) device by using the Microsoft Windows Driver Frameworks (WDF). This sample is written for the OSR USB-FX2 Learning Kit. The specification for the device can be found at <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=64091" data-raw-source="[Using the OSR USB FX-2 Learning Kit V2.0](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=64091)">Using the OSR USB FX-2 Learning Kit V2.0</a>.</p></td>

<td><p>The USBSAMP sample shows how to perform bulk and isochronous data transfers to a generic USB device by using the Windows Driver Framework (WDF). This sample is written for the Intel 82930 USB test board. It contains a console test application to initiate bulk and isochronous transfers and obtain information about the device&#39;s I/O endpoints. The application also demonstrates how to use GUID-based device names and pipe names that are generated by the operating system using the <strong>SetupDiXXX</strong> user-mode APIs.</p></td>
