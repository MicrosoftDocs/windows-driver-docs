# Windows USB Type-C troubleshooting notifications

Windows provides notifications to help users identify and fix issues when connecting USB Type-C devices, chargers, or accessories. These notifications alert users to problems with power delivery, device compatibility, or connection modes. They also guide users toward solutions for better performance and functionality. This article explains the different types of USB Type-C troubleshooting notifications in Windows, when they appear, and the technical conditions that trigger them.

## Power notifications

The following table describes the notifications that appear in Windows when power-related issues are detected with USB Type-C connections. These notifications help users understand problems such as slow charging, insufficient power delivery, or devices that require more power than the system can provide. Each notification is listed with its typical scenario and the technical conditions that trigger it on different types of systems.

| Notification | Scenario | Trigger conditions for systems with UCSI | Trigger conditions for systems with custom UCM client driver |
|--|--|--|--|
| **Slow charger**<br><br>To speed up charging, use a higher-watt charger. | User connects a slow USB-C charger. | In response to UCSI command **GET_CONNECTOR_STATUS**, UCSI PPM returns with both of the following fields.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull; ``ConnectorStatusChange.BatteryChargingStatusChange = 1``<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull; `BatteryChargingCapabilityStatus = 2` (Slow Charging) or<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull; `BatteryChargingCapabilityStatus = 3` (Trickle Charging)<br><br>For more information, see [USB Type-C slow charging notification requirements](usb-type-c-slow-charging-notification-requirements.md). | The UcmCx client driver calls **UcmConnectorPdConnectionStateChanged** with the following parameter.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull; `Params->ChargingState = UcmChargingStateSlowCharging`  or <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull; `Params->ChargingState = UcmChargingStateTrickleCharging` |
| **PC isn't charging**<br><br>Use the recommended charger and cable, and make sure it's directly plugged in. | User connects a USB-C charger that is too weak to charge the system. | In response to UCSI command **GET_CONNECTOR_STATUS**, UCSI PPM returns with both of the following fields.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull; ``ConnectorStatusChange.BatteryChargingStatusChange = 1``<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull; `BatteryChargingCapabilityStatus = 0` (Not Charging)<br><br>For more information, see [USB Type-C slow charging notification requirements](usb-type-c-slow-charging-notification-requirements.md). | The UcmCx client driver calls **UcmConnectorPdConnectionStateChanged** with the following parameter.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull; `Params->ChargingState = UcmChargingStateNotCharging` |
| **USB device might need more power**<br><br>Your PC might not provide enough power to the USB device.&nbsp;Connect your device to external power, or try using a&nbsp;different PC. | User connects a USB-C device which maximum power requirements are greater than what the system can ever provide. | In response to UCSI command **GET_CONNECTOR_STATUS**, UCSI PPM returns with the following field.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull; `RequestDataObject.CapabilityMismatch(B26) = 1`<br><br>For more information on Request Data Object, see the [USB Power Delivery specification](https://www.usb.org/document-library/usb-power-delivery). | The UcmCx client driver calls **UcmConnectorPdConnectionStateChanged** with the following parameter. <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull; `Params->Rdo.CapabilityMismatch = 1`<br><br>For more information on Request Data Object, see the [USB Power Delivery specification](https://www.usb.org/document-library/usb-power-delivery). |

## Mode notifications

The following table lists notifications that appear in Windows when there are issues with USB Type-C connection modes, such as USB4, Thunderbolt, DisplayPort, or other alternate modes. These notifications help users spot compatibility or configuration problems that might limit device functionality. The table also describes the technical conditions that trigger each notification.

| Notification | Scenario | Trigger conditions for systems with UCSI | Trigger conditions for systems with custom UCM client driver |
|--|--|--|--|
| **USB4 device functionality might be limited**<br><br>Make sure the USB4 device you're connecting to is supported by your PC. Select this message for more troubleshooting info. | User connects a USB4 device to a system that doesn't support USB4. | On the system that doesn't support USB4, the USB4 device enumerates a USB Billboard device with a Billboard capability descriptor which meets both of the following conditions.<br><br>1. USB4 mode SVID 0xFF00 is present in the wSVID field.<br>2. The corresponding entry in the bmConfigure field indicates the mode is *not* configured (value 0, 1 or 2). | Same as the UCSI System case. |
| **Use different USB port**<br><br>The USB device might have limited functionality when connected to this port. Plug the device into a different USB port on your PC. | User connects a USB4 device to a USB port that doesn't support USB4, but the system supports USB4 on other USB ports. | On the system that supports USB4, the USB4 device enumerates a USB Billboard device with a Billboard capability descriptor which meets both of the following conditions.<br><br>1. USB4 mode SVID 0xFF00 is present in the wSVID field.<br>2. The corresponding entry in the bmConfigure field indicates that the mode is "not attempted or exited" (value 1). | Same as the UCSI System case. |
| **Thunderbolt device functionality might be limited**<br><br>Make sure the Thunderbolt device you're connecting to is supported by your PC. Select this message for more troubleshooting info. | User connects a Thunderbolt device to a system that doesn't support Thunderbolt. | The Thunderbolt device enumerates a USB Billboard device with a Billboard capability descriptor which meets both the following conditions.<br><br>1. Thunderbolt Alternate Mode SVID 0x8087 is present in the wSVID field.<br>2. The corresponding entry in the bmConfigure field indicates that the mode is *not* configured (value 0, 1 or 2).<br><br>If the USB-C device also supports USB4, its notifications take precedence, or suppress this Thunderbolt notification as long as USB4 mode is configured. | Same as the UCSI System case. |
| **Display connection might be limited**<br><br>Make sure the DisplayPort device you're connecting to is supported by your PC.
