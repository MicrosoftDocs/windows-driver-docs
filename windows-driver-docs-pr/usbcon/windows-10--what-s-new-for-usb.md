# Windows 10: What's new for USB

This topic highlights the new features and improvements for Universal Serial Bus (USB) in Windows 10.

- **UCSI driver extension**
    Starting in Windows 10, version 1809, a new class extension for UCSI (UcmUcsiCx.sys) has been added,which implements the UCSI specification in a transport agnostic way. With minimal amount of code, your driver, which is a client to UcmUcsiCx, can communicate with the USB Type-C hardware over non-ACPI transport. This topic describes the services provided by the UCSI class extension and the expected behavior of the client driver.

- **USB Type-C Port Controller Interface**

    Windows 10 version 1703 provides a class extension (UcmTcpciCx.sys) that supports the Universal Serial Bus Type-C Port Controller Interface Specification. A USB Type-C connector driver does not need to maintain any internal PD/Type-C state.
    The complexity of managing the USB Type-C connector and USB Power Delivery (PD) state machines is handled by the system. You only need to write a client driver that communicates hardware events to the system through the class extension.

- **USB Dual Role support.**

    USB Dual Role controllers are now supported in Windows. Windows includes in-box client drivers for ChipIdea and Synopsys controllers. For other controllers, Microsoft provides a set of programming interfaces that allow the dual-role class extension (UrsCx) and its client driver to communicate with each other to handle the role-switching capability of a dual-role controller.

    For more information about this feature, see:

- **New set of programming interfaces for developing a USB Type-C connector driver.**

    This version introduces native support for USB Type-C as defined in the USB 3.1 specification. The feature allows devices to use a reversible connector, a symmetric cable, faster charging, and Alternate Modes running over the USB cable. These programming interfaces allow you to write a driver for the connector (called the client driver in this section) that communicates with the Microsoft-provided class extension module: UcmCx to handle scenarios related to Type-C connectors such as, which ports support Type-C, which ports support power delivery.

- **New set of programming interfaces for developing an emulated host controller and a connected virtual device.**

    Windows 10 introduces support for emulated devices. Now you can develop an emulated Universal Serial Bus (USB) host controller driver and a connected virtual USB device. Both components are combined into a single KMDF driver that communicates with the Microsoft-provided USB device emulation class extension (UdeCx).

- **New set of programming interfaces for developing a USB host controller driver.**

    You can develop a host controller if your hardware is not xHCI specification-compliant or your are writing a virtual host controller, such as a controller that routes USB traffic over a TCP connection to the peripherals attached to a device. Your host controller driver is a client to the USB host controller extension, which is a system-supplied driver that follows the framework class extension model. Within the [Microsoft USB 3.0 Driver Stack](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/index#usb-3-0-driver-stack), UCX provides functionality to assist the host controller driver in managing a USB host controller device.

- **New set of programming interfaces for developing a USB function controller driver.**

    You can write a client driver that communicates with the USB function class extension (UFX) and implements controller-specific operations. UFX handles USB function logic that is common to all USB function controllers.

- **Improved experience for USB CDC (serial) devices.**

    Allows devices that are compliant with the USB communication devices Class (Class\_02 & SubClass\_02) to work with Windows 10 by using the Usbser.sys driver. Device manufacturers are no longer required to write a custom INF to install that driver.
