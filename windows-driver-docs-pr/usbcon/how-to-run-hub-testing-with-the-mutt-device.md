# USB hub testing with MUTT devices

The goal of hub testing is to generate a complete set of possible traffic patterns from devices. You can test disconnect scenarios by adding an upstream SuperMUTT pack.

## Hub testing prerequisites

Before you run the MUTT test commands at an elevated command prompt, make sure you meet the following requirements:

- The test system must be running the latest version of Windows.
- Set up and configure the MUTT device and install the firmware. For more information, see [How to prepare the test system to run MUTT test tools](mutt-testing-options.md).

## Recommended hub tests

- USB IF electrical tests. All of our tests are protocol and state focused. See [USB-IF Compliance Program](https://www.usb.org/compliance) for more information on electrical tests.
- MUTT stress and transfer tests included in the MUTT software package with MUTT devices connected in the suggested configurations for USB controllers. **RunTest.bat** runs both the stress and transfer tests. See [How to run stress and transfer performance tests for MUTT devices](how-to-run-stress-and-transfer-and-super-mutt-performance-tests-for-mutt-devices.md).
- Device Fundamental test. For more information, see [How to run devfund tests in Visual Studio for MUTT devices](how-to-run-device-fundamental-tests-in-visual-studio-for-connected-mutt-devices.md).
- Controller Windows Hardware Certification Kit tests. For more information, see [USB-IF Certification Validation Test (Controller)](/previous-versions/windows/hardware/hck/jj124634(v=vs.85)).
- Manual test cases for host controllers, as found in Windows Test Guidance document in the section.

## Recommended topologies for hub testing with MUTT devices

- Attach MUTT devices to each available downstream port.
- Attach SuperMUTTs to half of the available ports. Attach MUTT devices to the remaining ports.
- Attach a SuperMutt Pack upstream of the hub under test and downstream ports have equal number of SuperMUTT and MUTT devices as shown in the following figure:
