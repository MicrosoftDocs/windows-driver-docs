# PnP and Power Management Scenarios


The following topics identify typical PnP and power management scenarios and show the sequence in which the framework calls a driver's event callback functions during these scenarios:

-   [A User Plugs in a Device](a-user-plugs-in-a-device.md)

-   [A User Unplugs a Device](a-user-unplugs-a-device.md)

-   [A Device Enters a Low-Power State](a-device-enters-a-low-power-state.md)

-   [A Device Returns to Its Working State](a-device-returns-to-its-working-state.md)

-   [The PnP Manager Redistributes System Resources](the-pnp-manager-redistributes-system-resources.md)
