# Breaking into a Debugger from KMDF Drivers


If you want your framework-based driver to break into a kernel-mode debugger, you can use the following:

-   The [**WdfVerifierDbgBreakPoint**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdfverifier/nf-wdfverifier-wdfverifierdbgbreakpoint) function breaks into the debugger if the [DbgBreakOnError](registry-values-for-debugging-kmdf-drivers.md) value is set in the registry.

-   The [**WDFVERIFY**](./wdfverify.md) macro tests a logical expression and breaks into the kernel debugger if the expression evaluates to **FALSE** and if the [VerifyOn](registry-values-for-debugging-kmdf-drivers.md) value is set in the registry.

-   The [**VERIFY\_IS\_IRQL\_PASSIVE\_LEVEL**](./verify-is-irql-passive-level.md) macro breaks into the kernel debugger if the driver is not executing at IRQL = PASSIVE\_LEVEL and if the **VerifyOn** value is set in the registry.

-   The [**ASSERT**](/previous-versions/windows/hardware/previsioning-framework/ff542107(v=vs.85)) macro tests a logical expression and breaks into the kernel debugger if the expression evaluates to **FALSE**.

-   The [**ASSERTMSG**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-assertmsg) macro tests an expression and, if the expression evaluates to **FALSE**, breaks into the kernel debugger and supplies a displayable text message to the debugger.

-   The [**DbgPrintEx**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-dbgprintex) and [**KdPrintEx**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-kdprintex) functions supply a displayable text message to the debugger.

The code for the WDFVERIFY and VERIFY\_IS\_IRQL\_PASSIVE\_LEVEL macros is included in your driver when you build your driver in a release or debug configuration. The code for the ASSERT and ASSERTMSG macros is included in your driver only when you build your driver in a debug configuration.
