# Supporting Power Management for DMA Devices


\[Applies to KMDF only\]

The DMA enabler object defines a set of optional event callback functions that drivers for DMA devices can use to manage transitions into and out of a device's working (D0) state.

Each time a DMA device enters its working state, and after the framework has called the driver's [*EvtDeviceD0Entry*](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdfdevice/nc-wdfdevice-evt_wdf_device_d0_entry) callback function, the framework calls the following DMA callback functions, in the order that they are listed:

<a href="" id="---------evtdmaenablerfill--------"></a>[*EvtDmaEnablerFill*](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdfdmaenabler/nc-wdfdmaenabler-evt_wdf_dma_enabler_fill)  
Allocates a device's DMA buffers.

<a href="" id="---------evtdmaenablerenable--------"></a>[*EvtDmaEnablerEnable*](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdfdmaenabler/nc-wdfdmaenabler-evt_wdf_dma_enabler_enable)  
Enables a device's DMA capability after the device enters its working (D0) state.

<a href="" id="---------evtdmaenablerselfmanagediostart--------"></a>[*EvtDmaEnablerSelfManagedIoStart*](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdfdmaenabler/nc-wdfdmaenabler-evt_wdf_dma_enabler_selfmanaged_io_start)  
Starts a DMA device's self-managed I/O operations.

Each time a DMA device leaves its working state, and before the framework has called the driver's [*EvtDeviceD0Exit*](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdfdevice/nc-wdfdevice-evt_wdf_device_d0_exit) callback functions, the framework calls the following DMA callback functions, in the order that they are listed:

<a href="" id="---------evtdmaenablerselfmanagediostop--------"></a>[*EvtDmaEnablerSelfManagedIoStop*](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdfdmaenabler/nc-wdfdmaenabler-evt_wdf_dma_enabler_selfmanaged_io_stop)  
Stops a DMA device's self-managed I/O operations.

<a href="" id="---------evtdmaenablerdisable--------"></a>[*EvtDmaEnablerDisable*](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdfdmaenabler/nc-wdfdmaenabler-evt_wdf_dma_enabler_disable)  
Disables a device's DMA capability before the device leaves its working (D0) state.

<a href="" id="---------evtdmaenablerflush--------"></a>[*EvtDmaEnablerFlush*](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdfdmaenabler/nc-wdfdmaenabler-evt_wdf_dma_enabler_flush)  
Deallocates a device's DMA buffers.

For more information about the order in which the framework calls a driver's event callback functions, see [PnP and Power Management Scenarios](pnp-and-power-management-scenarios.md).
