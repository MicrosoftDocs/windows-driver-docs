# Handling interrupts in UMDF drivers


[!include[UMDF 1 Deprecation](../includes/umdf-1-deprecation.md)]

Starting in UMDF version 1.11, UMDF drivers can handle hardware interrupts. UMDF supports both line-based (both level-triggered and edge-triggered) and message-signaled (MSI) interrupts.

Line-based, level-triggered interrupts are available starting in WindowsÂ 8. MSI and line-based, edge-triggered interrupts are available on all operating systems that UMDF 1.11 supports.

Framework-based drivers manage hardware interrupts by using framework interrupt objects.
