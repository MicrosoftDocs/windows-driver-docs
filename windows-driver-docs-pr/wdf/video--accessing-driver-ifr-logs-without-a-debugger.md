# Video: Accessing driver IFR logs without a debugger

This topic contains a video tutorial that shows how a driver can access IFR logs without a debugger attached.

To learn how to configure your driver to use Inflight Recorder (IFR), see [Inflight Trace Recorder for logging traces](../devtest/using-wpp-recorder.md).

You can find the GetIfr.ps1 script described in the video in the [WDF GitHub repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-Driver-Frameworks/tree/master/Tools).
