# Porting a Driver from WDM to WDF


The topics in this section describe how to convert an existing WDM driver to a Kernel-Mode Driver Framework (KMDF) driver or a User-Mode Driver Framework (UMDF) version 2 driver.

Architecturally, Windows Driver Frameworks (WDF) drivers are similar to WDM drivers. A WDM driver consists of a [*DriverEntry*](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nc-wdm-driver_initialize) function, various dispatch routines that the operating system calls to service I/O requests, and additional driver-specific utility functions. A WDF driver consists of a [**DriverEntry**](./driverentry-for-kmdf-drivers.md) function, various event callback functions that the framework calls to service I/O requests, and additional driver-specific utility functions. However, within this broad structure, the two models have important differences.
