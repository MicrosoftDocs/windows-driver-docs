# Windows Driver Frameworks

Windows Driver Frameworks (WDF) is an abstraction layer that takes care of much of the common code required to write a Windows driver. A lot of the required boilerplate is provided, so when you use WDF you can opt in to providing driver-specific functionality.

WDF drivers include both Kernel-Mode Driver Framework (KMDF) and User-Mode Driver Framework (UMDF).

For detailed change logs showing new functionality added in each framework release, see [KMDF Version History](kmdf-version-history.md) and [UMDF Version History](umdf-version-history.md).

Windows 11 and Windows Server 2022 include KMDF version 1.33 and UMDF version 2.33.

You can use these framework versions to build drivers for:

- Windows 10 and 11 (all SKUs)
- Windows Server 2022
