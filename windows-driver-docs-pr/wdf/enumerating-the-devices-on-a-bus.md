# Enumerating the Devices on a Bus


*Bus enumeration* is the act of determining which child devices are connected to a parent device. A parent device is typically a bus adapter, but it can also be a device that supports multiple functions, such as a sound card, for which each function requires a separate set of drivers.

Kernel-Mode Driver Framework (KMDF) supports two types of bus enumeration:

-   [Static enumeration](static-enumeration.md), which is easy to implement and is ideal if the number and type of child devices is not system-specific and does not change after the hardware has been plugged in.

-   [Dynamic enumeration](dynamic-enumeration.md), which should be used if the number or type of child devices changes from one computer to another.

A bus driver can use either or both types of bus enumeration.

For more information about writing a KMDF bus driver, see [Bus Driver Development Based on KMDF](/previous-versions/windows/hardware/design/dn613892(v=vs.85)).
