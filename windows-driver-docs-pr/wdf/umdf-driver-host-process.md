# UMDF Driver Host Process


This topic describes the User-Mode Driver Framework (UMDF) driver host process and how it works with other UMDF components. It applies to both UMDF versions 1 and 2.

The driver host process (Wudfhost.exe) is a child process of the driver manager service. Wudfhost.exe usually runs in the *LocalService* account, which has minimum privileges on the local computer. An instance of Wudfhost.exe loads one or more UMDF driver DLLs, in addition to the framework DLLs. The driver host process provides a runtime environment that handles interprocess communication (IPC) between the driver manager and the reflector, as well as I/O dispatching, driver loading, driver layering, and thread pool management.

The driver manager can create multiple concurrent instances of Wudfhost.exe, as follows:

-   If your UMDF driver was built with version 1.11 and is running on Windows 8, by default the driver manager creates a single instance of Wudfhost that can host multiple device stacks. This technique is called *device pooling*.

    If your UMDF driver was built with version 2 and is running on Windows 8.1 or Windows 10, pooling is also on by default.

-   If your driver was built with UMDF version 1.9 or earlier, the framework creates a separate instance of the host process (Wudfhost) for each device stack.

For more about device pooling, see [Using Device Pooling in UMDF Drivers](using-device-pooling-in-umdf-drivers.md).

Each Wudfhost.exe process runs in its own address space, and is therefore isolated from application processes and other instances of the driver host. UMDF drivers running in the same process (*device pooling*) share an address space and are not isolated from each other.

You can load drivers built with UMDF versions 1 and 2 concurrently, either in the same host process or in different host processes. For example, by default, the driver manager would load a UMDF 1.11 driver and a UMDF 2 driver in the same host process on a computer running Windows 8.1 or later.

However, you cannot load UMDF version 1 and 2 drivers in the same device stack. For example, you cannot load a UMDF version 1 filter driver above a UMDF version 2 function driver.

For a diagram that shows how the driver host relates to other UMDF components, see [Overview of UMDF](overview-of-the-umdf.md).
