# Revise Code That Handles Completed Requests


Windows Driver Frameworks (WDF) provides three methods that complete I/O requests:

-   [**WdfRequestComplete**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdfrequest/nf-wdfrequest-wdfrequestcomplete)
-   [**WdfRequestCompleteWithInformation**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdfrequest/nf-wdfrequest-wdfrequestcompletewithinformation)
-   [**WdfRequestCompleteWithPriorityBoost**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdfrequest/nf-wdfrequest-wdfrequestcompletewithpriorityboost) (KMDF only)

For information about using these methods, see [Completing I/O Requests](completing-i-o-requests.md).
