# Porting DriverEntry


In both WDM and framework-based drivers, the [**DriverEntry**](./driverentry-for-kmdf-drivers.md) function is the primary entry point. The function prototype is the same in both models. In a WDM driver, the system calls **DriverEntry** when the driver is first loaded into memory. DriverEntry sets a pointer to the driver’s [*AddDevice*](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nc-wdm-driver_add_device) routine in the **DriverExtension-&gt;AddDevice** field of the [**DRIVER\_OBJECT**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/ns-wdm-_driver_object) structure, sets pointers to its I/O dispatch routines in the **MajorFunction** array of the DRIVER\_OBJECT structure, and then returns. In a framework-based driver, the system calls the framework’s internal **FxDriverEntry** function upon loading the driver. This internal function initializes the framework and then calls the driver’s **DriverEntry** function. **DriverEntry** sets a pointer to the driver’s [*EvtDriverDeviceAdd*](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdfdriver/nc-wdfdriver-evt_wdf_driver_device_add) callback and calls [**WdfDriverCreate**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdfdriver/nf-wdfdriver-wdfdrivercreate) to create the WDFDRIVER object, as the following example shows:

```cpp
NTSTATUS
DriverEntry(
    IN PDRIVER_OBJECT  DriverObject
    IN PUNICODE_STRING RegistryPath
    )
{
    WDF_DRIVER_CONFIG config;

    WDF_DRIVER_CONFIG_INIT( &config,
                              ToasterEvtDeviceAdd );
    status = WdfDriverCreate(
                 DriverObject,
                 RegistryPath,
                 WDF_NO_OBJECT_ATTRIBUTES,
                 &config,
                 WDF_NO_HANDLE
             );

    return STATUS_SUCCESS;
}
```

**DriverEntry** also initializes any global data or resources that the driver requires, such as creating a lookaside list or initializing tracing. Note that although [**WdfDriverCreate**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdfdriver/nf-wdfdriver-wdfdrivercreate) returns a handle to the WDFDRIVER object, the driver does not retain this handle, just as a WDM driver might not retain the DRIVER\_OBJECT pointer that was passed to its **DriverEntry** routine. The reason is the same: only a few drivers use the pointer to the driver object.
