# File Creation by a USB I/O Target


[!include[UMDF 1 Deprecation](../includes/umdf-1-deprecation.md)]

During its initialization, the USB I/O target creates an intra-stack file object, which represents a default session that the USB I/O target keeps open. For more information about an intra-stack file object, see [Creating a File Object to Handle I/O](creating-a-file-object-to-handle-i-o.md). The USB I/O target or its USB pipe target children use this file object to send any I/O that they originate (for example, I/O to obtain the USB configuration descriptor).

The driver can use this intra-stack file object in format functions (for example, the driver can pass a pointer to this file object to the *pFile* parameter in a call to the [**IWDFIoTarget::FormatRequestForRead**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wudfddi/nf-wudfddi-iwdfiotarget-formatrequestforread) method) if the driver must send I/O on this file object's default session. To obtain the intra-stack file object, the driver can call the [**IWDFIoTarget::GetTargetFile**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wudfddi/nf-wudfddi-iwdfiotarget-gettargetfile) method.

This intra-stack file object is closed when the I/O target is disposed of either explicitly, when the driver calls the [**IWDFObject::DeleteWdfObject**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wudfddi/nf-wudfddi-iwdfobject-deletewdfobject) method on the I/O target, or implicitly, when the I/O target's parent is disposed of.

If any I/O remains outstanding on this intra-stack file object at the time of device removal, this file object will fail to close, and UMDF will generate a driver stop. For more information, see [Creating and Using Driver-Created File Objects](creating-and-using-driver-created-file-objects.md).
