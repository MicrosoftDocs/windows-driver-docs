# General I/O Targets in UMDF


[!include[UMDF 1 Deprecation](../includes/umdf-1-deprecation.md)]

General I/O targets, which can be either *local* or *remote*, are I/O targets that do not support special, device-specific data formats, such as USB request blocks. Before drivers send data to a general I/O target, they must put data into a write buffer in a format that the I/O target and device can interpret. Likewise, when drivers read data from a general I/O target, the drivers must be able to interpret the contents of data buffers that they receive from the target.

Drivers often send I/O requests to the next-lower driver in the driver stack. Therefore, each UMDF-based driver has a *default I/O target* for each device, which is the device's next-lower driver. The default I/O target for the lowest-level UMDF-based driver is the kernel-mode [reflector](overview-of-the-umdf.md).

Sometimes a UMDF-based driver must send I/O requests to a file-handle-based I/O target, such as a file or a network socket. Therefore, the framework also provides file-handle-based I/O target objects.

Both the default I/O target and file-handle-based I/O targets are called *local I/O targets*, because UMDF-based drivers use these targets to send I/O requests to devices that the driver stack supports.

<a href="" id="remote-i-o-targets-------"></a>**Remote I/O Targets**   
Occasionally, a driver must send an I/O request to a different driver stack. Therefore, the framework also provides *remote I/O targets*, which consist of all of the I/O targets except local I/O targets.

A remote I/O target might be a device that the driver stack does not support, a file on that device, or a [device interface](using-device-interfaces-in-umdf-drivers.md) for that device.
