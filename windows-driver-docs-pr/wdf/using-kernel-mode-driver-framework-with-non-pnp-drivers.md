# Using Kernel-Mode Driver Framework with Non-PnP Drivers





If you are writing a driver for a device that does not support Plug and Play (PnP), the driver must:

-   Set the [**WdfDriverInitNonPnpDriver**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdfdriver/ne-wdfdriver-_wdf_driver_init_flags) flag in the [**WDF\_DRIVER\_CONFIG**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdfdriver/ns-wdfdriver-_wdf_driver_config) structure's **DriverInitFlags** member.

-   Provide an [*EvtDriverUnload*](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdfdriver/nc-wdfdriver-evt_wdf_driver_unload) event callback function.

-   Create framework device objects that only represent [control device objects](using-control-device-objects.md).

If your device does not support PnP, your driver does *not* provide an [*EvtDriverDeviceAdd*](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdfdriver/nc-wdfdriver-evt_wdf_driver_device_add) callback function. Instead, the driver must determine if its device is present.
