# Processing I/O Requests





When a driver [receives](receiving-i-o-requests.md) an I/O request, it can:

-   [Requeue](requeuing-i-o-requests.md) the request to a different queue.

-   [Complete](completing-i-o-requests.md) the request.

-   [Cancel](canceling-i-o-requests.md) the request.

-   [Forward](forwarding-i-o-requests.md) the request to an I/O target.

The driver cannot ignore or delete the request.
