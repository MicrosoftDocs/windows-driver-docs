# USB I/O Targets in UMDF

[!include[UMDF 1 Deprecation](../includes/umdf-1-deprecation.md)]

Each universal serial bus (USB) device, and each pipe that a USB device interface supports, has a separate I/O target. I/O that the USB device processes is sent to the device's I/O target. I/O that a specific pipe processes is sent to that pipe's I/O target.
