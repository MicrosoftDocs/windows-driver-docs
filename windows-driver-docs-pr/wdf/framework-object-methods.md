# Framework Object Methods





Each framework object exports a set of methods (functions). Each method serves one of two purposes:

-   It performs an action that is associated with the object.

    For example, the [**WdfIoQueueCreate**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdfio/nf-wdfio-wdfioqueuecreate) method creates an I/O queue for a device.

    Methods that perform an action typically return an [NTSTATUS value](../kernel/using-ntstatus-values.md).

-   It retrieves or modifies a [property](framework-object-properties.md) that is associated with the object.

    For example, the [**WdfRequestGetInformation**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdfrequest/nf-wdfrequest-wdfrequestgetinformation) method returns information about an I/O request's completion status.

    Methods that retrieve a property typically return the property's value, while methods that modify a property typically do not return a value.

Each object method accepts an object handle as input. If a driver passes an invalid object handle to an object method, a system bug check occurs.
