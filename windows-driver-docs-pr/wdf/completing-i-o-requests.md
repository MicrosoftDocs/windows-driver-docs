# Completing I/O Requests





Every framework-based driver must eventually complete every I/O request that it receives from the framework. Drivers complete requests by calling the request object's [**WdfRequestComplete**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdfrequest/nf-wdfrequest-wdfrequestcomplete), [**WdfRequestCompleteWithInformation**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdfrequest/nf-wdfrequest-wdfrequestcompletewithinformation), or [**WdfRequestCompleteWithPriorityBoost**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdfrequest/nf-wdfrequest-wdfrequestcompletewithpriorityboost) method.

### When to Complete a Request

A driver must complete a request when it determines that one of the following cases is true:

-   The requested I/O operation has finished successfully.

-   The requested I/O operation was started but failed before it finished.

-   The requested I/O operation is not supported, or was not valid at the time it was received, and could not be started.

-   The requested I/O operation was canceled.

If the driver services the I/O request by creating I/O activity on the device, the driver typically calls [**WdfRequestComplete**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdfrequest/nf-wdfrequest-wdfrequestcomplete) from its [*EvtInterruptDpc*](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdfinterrupt/nc-wdfinterrupt-evt_wdf_interrupt_dpc) or [*EvtDpcFunc*](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdfdpc/nc-wdfdpc-evt_wdf_dpc) callback function.

If the driver receives an unsupported or otherwise invalid request, it typically calls [**WdfRequestComplete**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdfrequest/nf-wdfrequest-wdfrequestcomplete) from the [request handler](request-handlers.md) that received the request.

If the I/O operation was [canceled](canceling-i-o-requests.md), the driver typically calls [**WdfRequestComplete**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdfrequest/nf-wdfrequest-wdfrequestcomplete) from its [*EvtRequestCancel*](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdfrequest/nc-wdfrequest-evt_wdf_request_cancel) callback function.

If the driver [forwards](forwarding-i-o-requests.md) the I/O request to an [I/O target](./introduction-to-i-o-targets.md), the driver completes the request after the I/O target completes the request, as follows:

-   If your driver forwards the I/O request [synchronously](sending-i-o-requests-synchronously.md) to the I/O target, the driver's call to the I/O target returns only after a lower-level driver has completed the request (unless an error occurs). After the I/O target returns, your driver must call [**WdfRequestComplete**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdfrequest/nf-wdfrequest-wdfrequestcomplete).

-   If your driver forwards the I/O request [asynchronously](sending-i-o-requests-asynchronously.md), you will want your driver to be notified when a lower-level driver completes the request. If your driver registers a [*CompletionRoutine*](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdfrequest/nc-wdfrequest-evt_wdf_request_completion_routine) callback function, the framework calls this callback function after the I/O target completes the request. The *CompletionRoutine* callback function typically calls [**WdfRequestComplete**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdfrequest/nf-wdfrequest-wdfrequestcomplete).

To register a [*CompletionRoutine*](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdfrequest/nc-wdfrequest-evt_wdf_request_completion_routine) callback function, the driver must call [**WdfRequestSetCompletionRoutine**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdfrequest/nf-wdfrequest-wdfrequestsetcompletionroutine) before it forwards the I/O request to an I/O target.

If your driver does not need to be notified when an I/O target completes an asynchronously forwarded I/O request, the driver does not have to register a [*CompletionRoutine*](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdfrequest/nc-wdfrequest-evt_wdf_request_completion_routine) callback function. Instead, the driver can set the [**WDF\_REQUEST\_SEND\_OPTION\_SEND\_AND\_FORGET**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdfrequest/ne-wdfrequest-_wdf_request_send_options_flags) flag when calling [**WdfRequestSend**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdfrequest/nf-wdfrequest-wdfrequestsend). In this case the driver does not call [**WdfRequestComplete**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdfrequest/nf-wdfrequest-wdfrequestcomplete).

A driver does not complete an I/O request that it has created by calling [**WdfRequestCreate**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdfrequest/nf-wdfrequest-wdfrequestcreate) or [**WdfRequestCreateFromIrp**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdfrequest/nf-wdfrequest-wdfrequestcreatefromirp). Instead, the driver must call [**WdfObjectDelete**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdfobject/nf-wdfobject-wdfobjectdelete) to delete the request object, typically after an I/O target has completed the request.

For example, a driver might receive a read or write request for an amount of data that is larger than the driver's I/O targets can handle at one time. The driver must divide the data into several smaller requests and send these smaller requests to one or more I/O targets. Techniques for handling this situation include:

-   Calling [**WdfRequestCreate**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdfrequest/nf-wdfrequest-wdfrequestcreate) to create a single additional request object that represents a smaller request.

    The driver can send this request synchronously to an I/O target. The smaller request's [*CompletionRoutine*](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdfrequest/nc-wdfrequest-evt_wdf_request_completion_routine) callback function can call [**WdfRequestReuse**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdfrequest/nf-wdfrequest-wdfrequestreuse) so that the driver can reuse the request and send it to the I/O target again. After the I/O target completes the last of the smaller requests, the *CompletionRoutine* callback function can call [**WdfObjectDelete**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdfobject/nf-wdfobject-wdfobjectdelete) to delete the driver-created request object and the driver can call [**WdfRequestComplete**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdfrequest/nf-wdfrequest-wdfrequestcomplete) to complete the original request.

-   Calling [**WdfRequestCreate**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdfrequest/nf-wdfrequest-wdfrequestcreate) to create several additional request objects that represent the smaller requests.

    The driver's I/O targets can process these multiple smaller requests asynchronously. The driver can register a [*CompletionRoutine*](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdfrequest/nc-wdfrequest-evt_wdf_request_completion_routine) callback function for each of the smaller requests. Each time that the *CompletionRoutine* callback function is called, it can call [**WdfObjectDelete**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdfobject/nf-wdfobject-wdfobjectdelete) to delete a driver-created request object. After the I/O target completes all of the smaller requests, the driver can call [**WdfRequestComplete**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdfrequest/nf-wdfrequest-wdfrequestcomplete) to complete the original request.

### <a href="" id="providing-completion-information"></a> Providing Completion Information

When a driver completes a request, it can optionally provide some additional information that other drivers can access. For example, a driver might provide the number of bytes that were transferred for a read or write request. To provide this information, the driver can do either of the following:

-   Call [**WdfRequestSetInformation**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdfrequest/nf-wdfrequest-wdfrequestsetinformation) before calling [**WdfRequestComplete**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdfrequest/nf-wdfrequest-wdfrequestcomplete).

-   Call [**WdfRequestCompleteWithInformation**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdfrequest/nf-wdfrequest-wdfrequestcompletewithinformation).

### <a href="" id="obtaining-completion-information"></a> Obtaining Completion Information

To obtain information about an I/O request that another driver has completed, a driver can:

-   Call [**WdfRequestGetStatus**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdfrequest/nf-wdfrequest-wdfrequestgetstatus) to obtain the completion status value that the lower-level driver specified when it called [**WdfRequestComplete**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdfrequest/nf-wdfrequest-wdfrequestcomplete).

-   Call [**WdfRequestGetCompletionParams**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdfrequest/nf-wdfrequest-wdfrequestgetcompletionparams) to obtain a [**WDF\_REQUEST\_COMPLETION\_PARAMS**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdfrequest/ns-wdfrequest-_wdf_request_completion_params) structure that contains additional information about the completed request, such as handles to memory objects that represent the request's buffers, or bus-specific information.

    A driver can call [**WdfRequestGetCompletionParams**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdfrequest/nf-wdfrequest-wdfrequestgetcompletionparams) only after it calls [**WdfRequestSend**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdfrequest/nf-wdfrequest-wdfrequestsend) to send the I/O request synchronously or asynchronously to an I/O target. The driver must not call **WdfRequestGetCompletionParams** after it calls one of the methods that send I/O requests to I/O targets only synchronously (such as [**WdfIoTargetSendReadSynchronously**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdfiotarget/nf-wdfiotarget-wdfiotargetsendreadsynchronously)).

-   Call [**WdfRequestGetInformation**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdfrequest/nf-wdfrequest-wdfrequestgetinformation) to obtain additional I/O completion information that the lower-level driver specified when it called [**WdfRequestSetInformation**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdfrequest/nf-wdfrequest-wdfrequestsetinformation) or [**WdfRequestCompleteWithInformation**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdfrequest/nf-wdfrequest-wdfrequestcompletewithinformation), if drivers in the driver stack provide such information.

If a driver sends an I/O request synchronously, it typically calls [**WdfRequestGetStatus**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdfrequest/nf-wdfrequest-wdfrequestgetstatus), [**WdfRequestGetCompletionParams**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdfrequest/nf-wdfrequest-wdfrequestgetcompletionparams), and [**WdfRequestGetInformation**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdfrequest/nf-wdfrequest-wdfrequestgetinformation) after the synchronous call returns. If a driver sends an I/O request asynchronously, it typically calls these methods from within a [*CompletionRoutine*](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdfrequest/nc-wdfrequest-evt_wdf_request_completion_routine) callback function.
