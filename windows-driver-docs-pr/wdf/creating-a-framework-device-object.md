# Creating a Framework Device Object


Every function driver, filter driver, and bus driver must create a framework device object for each instance of a supported device that is connected to the system.

Creating a framework device object involves three steps:

1.  Obtaining a pointer to a [**WDFDEVICE\_INIT**](./wdfdevice_init.md) structure.

    This is an opaque, system-allocated structure, into which the driver stores information about a device.

2.  Initializing the WDFDEVICE\_INIT structure.

    The driver calls a set of framework-supplied functions that add information to the structure.

3.  Calling [**WdfDeviceCreate**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdfdevice/nf-wdfdevice-wdfdevicecreate).

    The driver passes the WDFDEVICE\_INIT structure's pointer to the **WdfDeviceCreate** method. The method creates a framework device object and uses information in the WDFDEVICE\_INIT structure to initialize the object.
