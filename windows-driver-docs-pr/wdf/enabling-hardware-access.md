# Enabling Hardware Access

[!include[UMDF 1 Deprecation](../includes/umdf-1-deprecation.md)]

To enable hardware access, a UMDF driver must set the **UmdfDirectHardwareAccess** INF directive to **AllowDirectHardwareAccess**.

For more information about INF directives in UMDF, see [Specifying WDF Directives in INF Files](specifying-wdf-directives-in-inf-files.md).
