# Accessing WDM Interfaces in KMDF Drivers


\[Applies to KMDF only\]

Most Kernel-Mode Driver Framework (KMDF) drivers do not need to access Windows Driver Model (WDM) interfaces directly. This section describes the limited cases when a KMDF driver requires direct access to WDM data structures, for example to obtain WDM information or manipulate an IRP.
