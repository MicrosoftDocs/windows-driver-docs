# Biometric Devices Design Guide


## <span id="ddk_biometric_design_guide_kg"></span><span id="DDK_BIOMETRIC_DESIGN_GUIDE_KG"></span>


This section describes how to write user-mode drivers that work with the Windows Biometric Driver Interface (WBDI). WBDI is the driver interface of the Windows Biometric Framework (WBF). WBF ships with Windows 7 and later versions of the Windows operating system.
