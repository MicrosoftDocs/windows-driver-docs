# Biometric Devices Design Guide Documentation

Welcome to the Biometric Devices Design Guide documentation. This documentation describes how to write user-mode drivers that work with the Windows Biometric Driver Interface (WBDI). WBDI is the driver interface of the Windows Biometric Framework (WBF). 

The WBDI provides essential resources and guidelines for developers and hardware manufacturers to create and implement drivers that facilitate seamless interaction with biometric devices, such as fingerprint readers, iris scanners, and facial recognition systems.

> [!CAUTION]
> While WudfBioUsbSample no longer ships as part of the WDK, the WBDI interface demonstrated by this sample and documented here is still the recommended way to write biometric drivers.
> 
> You can still find the sample in previous releases of the Windows driver samples repo, for example [Windows 11, version 22H2 - May 2022 Driver Samples Update](https://github.com/microsoft/Windows-driver-samples/releases/tag/win11-22h2).

## Getting Started

To get started with writing biometric drivers, see the following topics:

- [Getting Started with Biometric Drivers](getting-started-with-biometric-drivers.md)
- [Roadmap for Developing Biometric Drivers](roadmap-for-developing-biometric-drivers.md)
- [Sample Biometric Driver](sample-biometric-driver.md)
