# Installing Serenum Devices





To install a device that is enumerated by Serenum, use the following *hardware ID* format for the device:

Serenum\\*XxxxYyyy*

Where: *Xxxx* is a field of four ASCII characters that specify the EISA Manufacturing ID; *Yyyy* is a field of four ASCII characters that specify the Product ID. Serenum IDs are documented in the [Plug and Play External COM Device Specification](/previous-versions/windows/hardware/design/dn614609(v=vs.85)).
