# Opening and Initializing a Serial Device

When Serial is used as a function driver, the following considerations apply to opening and initializing a serial device:

- Serial supports only one open at a time on a serial device.

- A device is in an undefined state when it is opened. A client should initialize a device to a known state before using the device. A user-mode client must use the communications functions that are supported by the Windows Base Services in the Microsoft Windows SDK. A kernel-mode client can use the IOCTL\_SERIAL\_SET\_Xxx and the IOCTL\_SERIAL\_INTERNAL\_Xxx requests. For more information see the [ntddser.h](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ntddser/)header.

- All clients must open a serial device when needed, and close the device immediately after they are through with the port.

- Serenum must open an RS-232 port to enumerate the port. Clients that hold an RS-232 port open indefinitely should not use Serenum.
