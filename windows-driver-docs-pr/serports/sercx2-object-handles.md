# SerCx2 Object Handles

This topic describes object handle types that are specifically defined for version 2 of the serial framework extension (SerCx2).

The SerCx2 device driver interface (DDI) uses these handle types to refer to objects that have features and capabilities that are specific to SerCx2.

Additionally, the SerCx2 DDI uses two of the generic object handle types, WDFDEVICE and WDFREQUEST, that are defined by the Kernel-Mode Driver Framework (KMDF).

For more information about framework handle types, see [Summary of Framework Objects](../wdf/summary-of-framework-objects.md).

This topic describes the following object handles:

* [SERCX2CUSTOMRECEIVE Object Handle](#sercx2customreceive-object-handle)
* [SERCX2CUSTOMRECEIVETRANSACTION Object Handle](#sercx2customreceivetransaction-object-handle)
* [SERCX2CUSTOMTRANSMIT Object Handle](#sercx2customtransmit-object-handle)
* [SERCX2CUSTOMTRANSMITTRANSACTION Object Handle](#sercx2customtransmittransaction-object-handle)
* [SERCX2PIORECEIVE Object Handle](#sercx2pioreceive-object-handle)
* [SERCX2PIOTRANSMIT Object Handle](#sercx2piotransmit-object-handle)
* [SERCX2SYSTEMDMARECEIVE Object Handle](#sercx2systemdmareceive-object-handle)
* [SERCX2SYSTEMDMATRANSMIT Object Handle](#sercx2systemdmatransmit-object-handle)

Header: 2.0\Sercx.h

##  SERCX2CUSTOMRECEIVE Object Handle

A **SERCX2CUSTOMRECEIVE** object handle is an opaque reference to a custom-receive object in version 2 of the serial framework extension (SerCx2).

The **SerCx2CustomReceiveCreate** method creates a custom-receive object. 
SerCx2 uses this object to manage I/O transactions that use a custom data-transfer mechanism to read data from the serial controller. This object is opaque to serial controller drivers. 

**SerCx2CustomReceiveCreate** supplies, as an output parameter, a SERCX2CUSTOMRECEIVE handle to the newly created custom-receive object.
 
SerCx2 and the serial controller driver use this handle to refer to the object in subsequent calls to SerCx2 methods and event callback functions.

After **SerCx2CustomReceiveCreate** creates the custom-receive object, this object exists for the lifetime of the framework device object that represents the serial controller device. 
The custom-receive object is automatically deleted when the device object is deleted. 
The serial controller driver must _not_ try to delete the custom-receive object by calling a method such as [WdfObjectDelete](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdfobject/nf-wdfobject-wdfobjectdelete).

A serial controller driver can, as an option, create a custom-receive object, but can create no more than one such object. 

The driver can create this object only under the following conditions:

* The driver previously created a PIO-receive object.
* The driver has *not* created a system-DMA-receive object.

For more information about PIO-receive objects, see [SERCX2PIORECEIVE Object Handle](#sercx2pioreceive-object-handle). 

For more information about system-DMA-receive objects, see [SERCX2SYSTEMDMARECEIVE Object Handle](#sercx2systemdmareceive-object-handle).

## SERCX2CUSTOMRECEIVETRANSACTION Object Handle

A **SERCX2CUSTOMRECEIVETRANSACTION** object handle is an opaque reference to a custom-receive-transaction object in version 2 of the serial framework extension (SerCx2).

The [SerCx2CustomReceiveTransactionCreate](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/sercx/nf-sercx-sercx2customreceivetransactioncreate) method creates a custom-receive-transaction object. 
SerCx2 uses this object to manage I/O transactions that use a custom data-transfer mechanism to read data received by the serial controller. 

This object is opaque to serial controller drivers. 

[SerCx2CustomReceiveTransactionCreate](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/sercx/nf-sercx-sercx2customreceivetransactioncreate) supplies, as an output parameter, a SERCX2CUSTOMRECEIVETRANSACTION handle to the newly created custom-receive-transaction object. 

SerCx2 and the serial controller driver use this handle to refer to the object in subsequent custom-receive transactions. 

For more information, see [SerCx2 Custom-Receive Transactions](./sercx2-custom-receive-transactions.md).

After [SerCx2CustomReceiveTransactionCreate](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/sercx/nf-sercx-sercx2customreceivetransactioncreate) creates the custom-receive-transaction object, this object exists for the lifetime of the framework device object that represents the serial controller device. 

The custom-receive-transaction object is automatically deleted when the device object is deleted. 

The serial controller driver must _not_ try to delete the custom-receive-transaction object by calling a method such as [WdfObjectDelete](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdfobject/nf-wdfobject-wdfobjectdelete).

A serial controller driver can, as an option, create a custom-receive-transaction object, but can create no more than one such object. 

The driver can create this object only under the following conditions:</wdcml:p>

* The driver previously created a PIO-receive object.
* The driver previously created a custom-receive object.

For more information about PIO-receive objects, see [SERCX2PIORECEIVE Object Handle](#sercx2pioreceive-object-handle). 
For more information about custom-receive objects, see [SERCX2CUSTOMRECEIVE Object Handle](#sercx2customreceive-object-handle).

Despite the similar lifetimes of custom-receive and custom-receive-transaction objects, these are defined as separate object types (and not combined into one type) to support the possible future expansion of the SerCx2 device driver interface.

##  SERCX2CUSTOMTRANSMIT Object Handle

A SERCX2CUSTOMTRANSMIT object handle is an opaque reference to a custom-transmit object in version 2 of the serial framework extension (SerCx2).

The [SerCx2CustomTransmitCreate](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/sercx/nf-sercx-sercx2customtransmitcreate) method creates a custom-transmit object.h SerCx2 uses this object to manage I/O transactions that write data to the serial controller. 
This object is opaque to serial controller drivers. 

[SerCx2CustomTransmitCreate](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/sercx/nf-sercx-sercx2customtransmitcreate) supplies, as an output parameter, a SERCX2CUSTOMTRANSMIT handle to the newly created custom-transmit object. 
SerCx2 and the serial controller driver use this handle to refer to the object in subsequent calls to SerCx2 methods and event callback functions.

After [SerCx2CustomTransmitCreate](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/sercx/nf-sercx-sercx2customtransmitcreate) creates the custom-transmit object, this object exists for the lifetime of the framework device object that represents the serial controller device. 

The custom-transmit object is automatically deleted when the device object is deleted. 
The serial controller driver must _not_ try to delete the custom-transmit object by calling a method such as [WdfObjectDelete](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdfobject/nf-wdfobject-wdfobjectdelete).

A serial controller driver can, as an option, create a custom-transmit object, but can create no more than one such object. 

The driver can create this object only under the following conditions:

* The driver previously created a PIO-transmit object.
* The driver has _not_ created a system-DMA-transmit object.
