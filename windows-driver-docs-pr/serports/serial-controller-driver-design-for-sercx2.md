# Serial Controller Driver Design for SerCx2

To manage your serial controller, you write a serial controller driver that performs hardware-specific tasks and communicates with SerCx2. Starting with WindowsÂ 8.1, SerCx2 is a system-supplied component that handles many of the processing tasks that are common to serial controllers. These tasks include managing time-outs and handling read and write requests sent by clients of the serial controller.

In response to a read or write request, SerCx2 issues one or more I/O transactions to the serial controller driver. From the driver's point of view, each transaction is a simple and complete I/O operation.</p></td>
