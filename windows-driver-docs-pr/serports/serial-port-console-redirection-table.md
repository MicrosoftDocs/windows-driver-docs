# Serial Port Console Redirection Table  (SPCR)

This document defines the content of the Serial Port Console Redirection Table. This table is used to indicate whether a serial port or a non-legacy UART interface is available for use with Microsoft® Windows® Emergency Management Services (EMS).

The table provides information about the configuration and use of the serial port or non-legacy UART interface. On a system where the BIOS or system firmware uses the serial port for console input/output, this table should be used to convey information about the settings, to ensure a seamless transition between the firmware console output and Windows EMS output.

This table must be located in system memory with other ACPI tables, and it must be referenced in the ACPI RSDT table.
