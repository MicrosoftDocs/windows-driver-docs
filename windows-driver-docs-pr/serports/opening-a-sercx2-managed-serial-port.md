# Opening a SerCx2-Managed Serial Port

Starting with WindowsÂ 8.1, version 2 of the serial framework extension (SerCx2) works together with a serial controller driver to manage a serial port on a serial controller. If your peripheral driver controls a device on a serial port that is jointly managed by SerCx2 and a serial controller driver, your driver can open a logical connection to this port and then send I/O requests to the device through the port.

A serial controller is a 16550 universal asynchronous receiver/transmitter (UART) or compatible device. For more information, see [Serial Controller Drivers Overview](serial-drivers-overview.md).
