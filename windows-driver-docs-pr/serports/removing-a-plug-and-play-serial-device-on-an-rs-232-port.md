# Removing a Plug and Play Serial Device on an RS-232 Port

The Plug and Play manager removes a serial device by sending a remove request to the top of a serial device stack. After Serenum receives a remove request for the serial device, it removes the device's PDO and completes the request. Serenum does not pass the request to the RS-232 port stack because the RS-232 port is the parent device for the serial device that is removed.
