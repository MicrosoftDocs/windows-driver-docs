Convert to slate (or laptop) as indicated by the test.

**Note**  
If the system can convert to the slate mode by using more than one method, please repeat the test steps for each method.

Various form factors allow for different methods of conversion, such as the following:

-   Attach or detach keyboard
-   Flip the screen
-   Swivel the screen
-   Slide the screen to cover or uncover the keyboard

**Conversion examples:**
