This topic describes common indicator step procedures and examples.

## <span id="touchkbd"></span><span id="TOUCHKBD"></span>Touch keyboard deployment steps


The following steps test whether the touch keyboard opens automatically (as opposed to the user opening it from the Taskbar). Apply the following steps each time the test instructs you to “Perform touch keyboard deployment steps”.

1.  Press the Windows button to navigate to **Start**.
2.  Slide to bring up the **Charms** menu and select **Search**.
3.  Tap into the edit field.

Convert to slate (or laptop) as indicated by the test.

**Note**  
If the system can convert to the slate mode by using more than one method, please repeat the test steps for each method.

Various form factors allow for different methods of conversion, such as the following:

-   Attach or detach keyboard
-   Flip the screen
-   Swivel the screen
-   Slide the screen to cover or uncover the keyboard

**Conversion examples:**
