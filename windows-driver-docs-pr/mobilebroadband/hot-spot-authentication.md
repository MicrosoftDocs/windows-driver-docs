# Hot spot authentication


You should offload data traffic to Wi-Fi hot spots whenever possible. Windows Connection Manager can automatically connect to Wi-Fi networks when they are available. To connect to Wi-Fi networks, you must provide hotspot credentials to Windows. You can provide hotspot credentials by implementing your own authentication in the app.
