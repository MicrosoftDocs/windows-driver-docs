# Mobile operator web portal

## Overview

This topic describes the web portal that enables mobile operators to provide connectivity solutions directly to Windows users through a curated web experience hosted in the Mobile Plans app. Mobile operators must create their web experiences following these design principles to ensure users have a high quality experience while navigating their portal. The mobile operator web portal is used for all scenarios supported in the Mobile Plans solution and is hence one of the most important components in the program.

For more information about web portal flow and reference design, see [Web portal flow and reference design](mobile-plans-appendix.md#web-portal-flow-and-reference-design).

## Web Portal interface for eSIM-enabled devices

The Mobile Plans app uses the [WebView](/uwp/api/Windows.UI.Xaml.Controls.WebView) control to host and present the mobile operator web portal experience. The portal is invoked by the app calling the mobile operator-hosted service endpoints directly, and returned content is rendered directly within the control

When starting the `WebView`, several parameters are passed to the portal as part of the invocation. If there is at least one eSIM profile associated with the mobile operator, the *iccids* are passed to the portal as well.

The following example shows these launch parameters for eSIM-enabled devices, embedded in the call to `MyWebView.Navigate()`.

```C#
MyWebView.ScriptNotify += MyWebView_ScriptNotify;

List<Uri> allowedUris = new List<Uri>();

allowedUris.AddRange(AllowedNotifyUris);

MyWebView.AllowedScriptNotifyUris = allowedUris;

MyWebView.Navigate(“https://moportal.com?market=US&location=US&transactionId=%2F7RBTuSJt02OZbX8.4&eid=89033023422130000000000199055797&imei=001102000315468&iccids=8988247000101867183,8988247000103824828”);
```

In order to provide backwards compatibility with app updates, the portal must disregard any additional parameters that might also be passed in the request. This ensures flexibility and ability to introduce new features in the app without disrupting the mobile operator's integration.

The following table describes the launch parameters available for eSIM.

| Parameter name | Description | Example  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| eid            | The eSIM Identifier. This is sent only if an eSIM is present.                                                                                                                            | `eid= 89033024010400000100000000009136`          |
| iccids         | Optional parameter. Specifies the list of ICCIDs from the available profile on an eSIM only. If there are no ICCIDs matching the MO available on the eSIM, this parameter is not sent. If an ICCID has trailing 'F', it is removed. | `iccids=8988247000100003319, 988247000100003555` |
| imei           | The device's IMEI number.                                                                                                                                                                | `imei=001201234567890`                           |
| location       | The two-letter ISO code of the user’s current physical location with country-level granularity.                                                                                                                    | `location=us`                                    |
| transactionId  | The Transaction ID used for debugging the session. Providers should log this and send it in the notification payload. Maximum size is 64 characters.                                     | `transactionId=waoigFfX00yGH3Vb.1`               |
| market         | The two-letter ISO code of the region settings in the PC.                                                                                                                                | `market=us`                                      |

The user’s language preference is sent using the Accept-Language header, described in the following table. Additionally, if there were any errors that occurred during a profile download, they are passed as headers in the next request. 

| Header name     | Description  | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Accept-Language | The user’s current language settings. The MO portal should render the contents in the specified language if possible. For more information, see [RFC 7231, section 5.3.5: Accept-Language](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-5.3.5). | `Accept-Language: en-us` |
| X-MP-LPAError-Codes      | This field provides the error code that has been captured in the LPA. If there are multiple errors, the error codes are passed in a comma-separated list. <p>For a list of possible error codes, see the [ESimOperationStatus enum](/uwp/api/windows.networking.networkoperators.esimoperationstatus).</p> | X-MP-LPAError-Codes: ServerFailure,ServerNotReachable                 |

| X-MP-LPAError-ICCIDs     | This field provides the ICCID of the eSIM profile that the user attempted to download and install. This ICCID was passed back to the Mobile Plans app when control handoff occurred. Only one ICCID is passed.                                                                                                                       | X-MP-LPAError-ICCIDs: 8988247000101997790                             |

## Web Portal interface for physical SIMs

The interface for invoking the mobile operator portal using legacy physical UICC is the same as for eSIM. However, the parameters passed to the portal are different.

```C#
MyWebView.Navigate(“https://moportal.com?iccid=8988247000100003319&imei=001102000311608&market=us&transactionId=waoigFfX00yGH3Vb.1&location=us”);
```
