# Determine which mobile broadband network is currently connected


You can determine which mobile broadband network youâ€™re connected to by retrieving the APN through the [**AccessPointName**](/uwp/api/Windows.Networking.NetworkOperators.MobileBroadbandNetwork#Windows_Networking_NetworkOperators_MobileBroadbandNetwork_AccessPointName) property of the current network object for the account.

For example:

``` syntax
account.currentNetwork.accessPointName
```
