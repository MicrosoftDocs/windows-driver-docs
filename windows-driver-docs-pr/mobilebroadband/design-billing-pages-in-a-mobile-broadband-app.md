# Design billing pages in a mobile broadband app

You should provide the user with the ability to view a billing summary, billing history, make payments, or recharge the plan.

The **Make a payment** form should adhere to form guidelines that are described in [Design purchase flows in a mobile broadband app](design-purchase-flows-in-a-mobile-broadband-app.md). This page can be linked to from the **Billing** page for post-paid plans, and through the **Recharge now** button on the landing page for prepaid plans.

Appropriate design for the billing page:

- Follow the form guidelines, including left alignment, white space, proper grid alignment, and touch friendliness.

- Use a simple layout to improve readability.

- Use vertical scrolling for long forms because this makes it easier to tab and to use the online keyboard.

- Make the making payments process a simple experience.

Inappropriate design for the billing page:

- Don’t try to fill up white space.

- Don’t use an iframe to host the flows. Instead, build flows directly into the app experience.

- Don’t make the user wait long times without providing visual feedback.

- Don’t link to external sites outside of the app.
