# Connection Profile API


The connection profile API, which is part of [**Windows.Networking.Connectivity.NetworkInformation**](/uwp/api/Windows.Networking.Connectivity.NetworkInformation), provides connectivity, usage, and data plan information for established network connections. The connection profiles associated with a given mobile account can be retrieved by using the [**MobileBroadbandAccount**](/uwp/api/Windows.Networking.NetworkOperators.MobileBroadbandAccount) API. The connection profile API allows your mobile broadband app to query several properties of the network connection on the mobile broadband interface, including the following:

-   [**GetNetworkConnectivityLevel**](/uwp/api/Windows.Networking.Connectivity.ConnectionProfile#Windows_Networking_Connectivity_ConnectionProfile_GetNetworkConnectivityLevel) Indicates whether the network is connected and if the network provides internet connectivity.

-   [**GetSignalBars**](/uwp/api/Windows.Networking.Connectivity.ConnectionProfile#Windows_Networking_Connectivity_ConnectionProfile_GetSignalBars) Indicates the current number of signal bars displayed by the Windows UI for the connection.

-   [**GetNetworkUsageAsync**](/uwp/api/Windows.Networking.Connectivity.ConnectionProfile#Windows_Networking_Connectivity_ConnectionProfile_GetNetworkUsageAsync_Windows_Foundation_DateTime_Windows_Foundation_DateTime_Windows_Networking_Connectivity_DataUsageGranularity_Windows_Networking_Connectivity_NetworkUsageStates_) Provides bytes sent, bytes received, and connectivity times for a connection profile.

This API also includes a status change event that notifies the application whenever connectivity on the operatorâ€™s interface has changed. For more info about the [**NetworkStatusChanged**](/uwp/api/Windows.Networking.Connectivity.NetworkInformation#Windows_Networking_Connectivity_NetworkInformation_NetworkStatusChanged) event, see [**NetworkStatusChangedEventHandler delegate**](/uwp/api/windows.networking.connectivity.networkstatuschangedeventhandler).
