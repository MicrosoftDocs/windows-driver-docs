# PackageInfo XML schema

[!include[MBAE deprecation warning](mbae-deprecation-warning.md)]

A metadata package contains one PackageInfo.xml document, which has information that the operating system uses to install the metadata package and reference its contents.

The data in the PackageInfo.xml document is formatted based on the PackageInfo XML schema, which is described in this section.

**Note**  
The XML document must be saved by using UTF-8 encoding.
