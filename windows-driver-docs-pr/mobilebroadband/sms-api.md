# SMS API


Windows provides the SMS API to receive operator overage and roaming notifications, send and receive user-to-user messages, and control the messaging configuration.

The SMS API supports the following use cases:

-   Send new SMS and new operator SMS notifications.

-   Send and read messages in text mode and Protocol Data Unit (PDU) mode (binary).

-   Get messages from the message store of the mobile broadband device.

-   Delete messages from the message store of the mobile broadband device.

-   Get properties of the mobile broadband device (account phone number, Global System for Mobile communication \[GSM\] or Code-Division Multiple Access \[CDMA\], and similar information).
