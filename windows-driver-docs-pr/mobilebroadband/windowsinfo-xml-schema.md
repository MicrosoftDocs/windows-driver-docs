# WindowsInfo XML schema overview

[!include[MBAE deprecation warning](../includes/mbae-deprecation-warning.md)]


A metadata package contains one WindowsInfo.xml document. This contains information that the operating system uses to define display actions for the service specified within the metadata package.

The data within the Windowsinfo.xml document is formatted based on the WindowsInfo XML schema, which is described in this section.

**Note**  
The XML document must be saved by using UTF-8 encoding.

 

For the complete definition of the WindowsInfo XML schema, see [WindowsInfo XML Schema Definition](windowsinfo-xml-schema-definition.md).

For information about the elements that are defined by the WindowsInfo XML schema, see [WindowsInfo XML Elements](windowsinfo-xml-elements.md).

For an example of XML data in the format that is defined by the WindowsInfo XML schema, see [WindowsInfo XML Example](windowsinfo-xml-example.md).
