# Desktop COSA/APN database settings

This topic describes the settings available in desktop COSA and the APN database (apndatabase.xml).

For more info about the Desktop COSA/APN database submission process, see [Planning your desktop COSA/APN database submission](planning-your-desktop-cosa-apn-database-submission.md).

For more info about COSA, see [COSA overview](cosa-overview.md).

For more info about the APN database, see [APN database overview](apn-database-overview.md).

|   AutoConnectOrder   | Windows tries connections to the APNs provided by the operator and marked as “auto-connect” in APN database or COSA until it successfully connects to the mobile network. If all auto-connect attempts fail, Windows will show a prompt allowing the user to pick an APN or enter a custom APN. |          Optional          |                                                   If you have more than one access string for an operator, this setting must start with 1. This is needed for Windows to try several APN entries that share either an IMSI range, ICCID range, CDMA provider ID, or CDMA provider name when the user tries to connect.                                                    |

| BrandingIcon | A custom logo that appears in the Windows Connection Manager next to your network entry. | Optional | Icons must have transparent backgrounds and smooth edges.

| UIName | If the target condition values (SPN, MCC, MNC, IMSI Range, ICCID Range, etc.) can't indicate the unique entry, then COSA will display this name to the end user to enable manual selection of which MO's connection value to use. | Optional | For example, **ContosoMVNO** is an MVNO. It doesn't have any unique values that can be used to distinguish itself from the main MO network, **Contoso**. In this case, **UIName** can be used and will be shown in the Windows Settings UI, enabling the user to manually select which MO provisioning settings to use. | Windows 10, version 1709 |
| UIOrder | The index to control the **UIName** value's dropdown list picker position. | Required if **UIName** is specified; Optional otherwise | If not specified, defaults to **0**. | Windows 10, version 1709 |

| AppID | A string describing the Package Family Name (PFN) and application ID of a mobile operator's UWP companion app. | Optional | In Windows 10, version 1803 and later, **AppID** is used to identify MOs with their companion apps. **AppID** must be declared in this format: <p>**PFN!AppId**</p><p>**Note** This format is case sensitive.</p><p>To obtain the PFN and AppId for your app, follow these steps:<ol><li>Acquire the PFN as specified on [View App Identity Details](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/publish/view-app-identity-details).</li><li>Locate the AppId by opening your solution's *AppManifest.XML* file and querying the AppXManifest for the application ID.</li></ol> <p>For more info about UWP companion apps for MOs, see [UWP mobile broadband apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/mobilebroadband/windows-store-mobile-broadband-apps).</p> | Windows 10, version 1803 |
| Hotspot | Determines if you want to permit users to share their mobile broadband connection as a personal hotspot. | Optional | Possible values: <ul><li>Never</li><li>Always</li><li>EntitlementCheckRequired</li></ul> <p>If left blank, defaults to "Always."</p> <p>The *EntitlementCheckRequired* option enables users to share their hotspots with an entitlement check, which requires a handler for Windows notification events. If this option is selected, you need to develop an MO UWP companion app to handle the entitlement check requests.</p> <p>For more info about UWP companion apps for MOs, see [UWP mobile broadband apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/mobilebroadband/windows-store-mobile-broadband-apps).</p><p>For more info about the EntitlementCheck API, see its [UWP API reference page](https://docs.microsoft.com/uwp/api/windows.networking.networkoperators.tetheringentitlementchecktriggerdetails).</p> | Windows 10, version 1803 |
