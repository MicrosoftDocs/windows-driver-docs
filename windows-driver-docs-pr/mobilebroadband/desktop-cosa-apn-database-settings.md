| | | Optional | The following optional purpose group value is available: <ul><li>**LTE attach** </li></ul> Specifying an LTE attach APN through COSA is typically unnecessary because the attach info is usually managed directly by the underlying modem's hardware. However, in the case where the modem's hardware does not have an LTE attach APN value and the network is incapable of assigning one to the UE, the MO can optionally provide LTE attach information so that the UE can LTE attach without the user manually entering a value. | Windows 10, version 1903 |

| DataMarketplaceRoamingUIEnabled | This setting controls whether the roaming UI should be shown for a SIM or eSIM that is part of the Mobile Plans service. | Optional | This setting works with the **SupportDataMarketPlace** setting. The possible values are: <ul><li>0: The roaming indicator will **never** be displayed.</li><li>1: The roaming indicator is displayed when the device is roaming in a foreign country.</li></ul> <p>If left blank, defaults to **1**.</p> | Windows 10, version 1709 |
| UIName | If the target condition values (SPN, MCC, MNC, IMSI Range, ICCID Range, etc.) can't indicate the unique entry, then COSA will display this name to the end user to enable manual selection of which MO's connection value to use. | Optional | For example, **ContosoMVNO** is an MVNO. It doesn't have any unique values that can be used to distinguish itself from the main MO network, **Contoso**. In this case, **UIName** can be used and will be shown in the Windows Settings UI, enabling the user to manually select which MO provisioning settings to use. | Windows 10, version 1709 |

| Hotspot | Determines if you want to permit users to share their mobile broadband connection as a personal hotspot. | Optional | Possible values: <ul><li>Never</li><li>Always</li><li>EntitlementCheckRequired</li></ul> <p>If left blank, defaults to "Always."</p> <p>The *EntitlementCheckRequired* option enables users to share their hotspots with an entitlement check, which requires a handler for Windows notification events. If this option is selected, you need to develop an MO UWP companion app to handle the entitlement check requests.</p> <p>For more info about UWP companion apps for MOs, see [UWP mobile broadband apps](./uwp-mobile-broadband-apps.md).</p><p>For more info about the EntitlementCheck API, see its [UWP API reference page](/uwp/api/windows.networking.networkoperators.tetheringentitlementchecktriggerdetails).</p> | Windows 10, version 1803 |

The slot is switched only if the user clicks "yes" on this toast. </li><li>"true": On SIM insert, the slot is switched automatically and then a toast is displayed informing the user that the slot has been switched. This toast doesn't take any button input from the user. The SIM removed behavior remains unchanged.</li></ul> <p>If not specified, defaults to "false".</p>| Windows 11 |
| WifiProfiles | Wifi profiles that will be included in the system while this mobile broadband profile is active. | Optional | <p>This entry supports multiple WifiProfile entries. Each WifiProfile entry must point to an .xml file with a WLANProfile. See [WLANProfile Element](/windows/win32/nativewifi/wlan-profileschema-wlanprofile-element).</p> <p>See an [example of WLAN Profile using EAP-AKA authentication](/windows/win32/nativewifi/eap-aka-profile-sample).</p> | Windows 11 |
