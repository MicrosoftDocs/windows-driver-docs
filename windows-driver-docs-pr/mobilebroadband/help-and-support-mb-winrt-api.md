# Help and support


You can reduce customer support calls by providing help and support through your mobile broadband app.

In your app, you can provide access to self-help material in addition to assisted support channels. You can create a section where the users can find answers to the most common questions. You can simplify the help information based on a user’s device or firmware.

You can simplify the user experience by showing help for the user’s device only. You can get device model and firmware information by using the [Subscriber and Device Information API](subscriber-and-device-information-api.md).
