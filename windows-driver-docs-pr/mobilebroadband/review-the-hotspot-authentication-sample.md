# Review the hotspot authentication sample


The [Hotspot Authentication Sample](/samples/microsoft/windows-universal-samples/hotspotauthentication/) demonstrates the application of a provisioning file and how it handles a hotspot authentication event. This sample does not run with privileged APIs; it demonstrates the application of signed provisioning metadata.

For an example of how to use unsigned provisioning metadata together with privilege APIs, see the [Mobile Broadband Provisioning sample](/samples/microsoft/windows-universal-samples/mobilebroadband/).
