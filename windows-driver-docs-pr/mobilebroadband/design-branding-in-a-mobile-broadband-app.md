# Design branding in a mobile broadband app

UWP apps encourage branding in the following ways:

- **Customization of colors and fonts** This includes being able to customize background colors and font colors. For example, you can use your look or brand colors in the app.

- **Use brand imagery** Windows Connection Manager uses logos together with metadata. We recommend that you keep the imagery simple, to keep the overall look and feel of the app inviting. You can use brand imagery on the splash screen and on the start screen tiles.

You can use branding in the following places in your mobile broadband app:

- Start screen tile (small)
