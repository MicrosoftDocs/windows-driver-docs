# Design services and goods pages in a mobile broadband app

You can use your mobile broadband app to publicize other related services. Use the recommended layouts to organize various services that you want to promote through the Microsoft Store. An example of service promotion with an organization into categories is provided here.

## <span id="Quick_summary"></span><span id="quick_summary"></span><span id="QUICK_SUMMARY"></span>Quick summary

Appropriate design for the Services and Goods page:

- Follow the grid layout for the services page.

- Use pictures and brief headings to describe each service.

- Use the Microsoft Store for cross promotion.

- Use natural panning and zooming as well as horizontal scrolling.

Inappropriate design for the services page:

- Donâ€™t link to external sites outside of the app.
