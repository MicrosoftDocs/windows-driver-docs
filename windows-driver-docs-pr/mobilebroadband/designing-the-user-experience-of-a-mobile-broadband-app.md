The mobile broadband app should include the following key scenarios:

The following shows how different pages in the app can be organized:

:::image type="content" source="images/mb-fig1-overview-uwp-device-app.png" alt-text="Diagram of a mobile broadband app's page organization and navigation.":::

- The app has an account overview landing page that provides a summary of a customer’s account and data usage. It also contains links to other app pages.

- From the landing page, end users can visit a hub page to view billing, plans, services, or help and support details.

- Some hub pages lead to task pages and flows, such as a purchase checkout flow.

**Tip**  
For prepaid plans, the account overview could directly link to a **Make a Payment** page for refill scenarios.
