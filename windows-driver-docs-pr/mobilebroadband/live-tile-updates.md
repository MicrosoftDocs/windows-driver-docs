# Live tile updates


On the Windows 10 **Start** menu, tiles are the primary representation of an app. Users start their apps through those tiles, and the tiles can display new, relevant, and tailored content to the users. You can keep tiles alive with activity and draw users back into your app repeatedly. You can display information about [Premium services](premium-services.md), or any important information that you want to bring to users’ attention.
