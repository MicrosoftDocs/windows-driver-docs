# NDIS\_STATUS\_WWAN\_IP\_ADDRESS\_STATE


Miniport drivers use the NDIS\_STATUS\_WWAN\_IP\_ADDRESS\_STATE notification to inform the MB service about changes to the IP configuration for an additional PDP context.

This notification uses the [**NDIS\_WWAN\_IP\_ADDRESS\_STATE**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ndiswwan/ns-ndiswwan-_ndis_wwan_ip_address_state) structure.

## Remarks

This notification must be sent on the NDIS port associated with the additional PDP context session.

Miniport drivers should send this notification after an additional PDP context has been successfully activated and the IP configuration has been acquired for that context. If the device indicates unsolicited IP configuration changes post-context activation, then miniport drivers should send an unsolicited indication with this notification with the updated IP configuration.
