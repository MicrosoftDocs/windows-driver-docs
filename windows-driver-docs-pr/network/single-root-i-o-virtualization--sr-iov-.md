# Introduction to Single Root I/O Virtualization (SR-IOV)


This section describes the NDIS single root I/O virtualization (SR-IOV) interface. Starting with NDIS 6.30, the SR-IOV interface supports Microsoft Hyper-V performance improvements for virtualized networks on Windows ServerÂ 2012 and later versions of Windows Server.

The SR-IOV specification from PCI-SIG defines the extensions to the PCI Express (PCIe) specification suite that enable multiple virtual machines (VMs) to share the same PCIe physical hardware resources. This section describes the NDIS SR-IOV interface and describes the techniques for writing an NDIS miniport driver for an SR-IOV capable network adapter that implements the PCIe SR-IOV specification.
