# Starting and Pausing a Binding





NDIS pauses a binding to stop data flow that could interfere with Plug and Play (PnP) operations, for example, adding or removing a filter module in a driver stack, or, to add a new binding. For more information about how to modify a running driver stack, see [Modifying a Running Driver Stack](modifying-a-running-driver-stack.md).

NDIS starts a binding from the *Paused* state. The binding enters the *Paused* state after the bind operation is complete or after a pause operation is complete.

The following topics provide more information about starting and pausing a binding:
