# Types of Filter Drivers





There are two primary types of filter drivers:

<a href="" id="monitoring"></a>Monitoring  
These filter drivers monitor the behavior in a driver stack. However, they only pass on information and do not modify the behavior of the driver stack. Monitoring filter drivers cannot modify or originate data.

<a href="" id="modifying"></a>Modifying  
These filter drivers modify the behavior of the driver stack. The type of modification is driver-specific.

The **FilterType** entry in the INF file is 0x00000001 for monitoring filter drivers and 0x00000002 for modifying filter drivers.

You can specify that a filter driver is mandatory. This feature is generally used with modifying filter drivers. If a mandatory filter driver does not load, the associated driver stack will be torn down. For more information about mandatory filter drivers, see [Mandatory Filter Drivers](mandatory-filter-drivers.md).
