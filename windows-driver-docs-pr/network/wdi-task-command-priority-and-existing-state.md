# WDI task command priority and existing state


When the adapter is in a particular state, new commands may come down to it that could affect the existing state (for example, a scan that affects existing connections). The table below describes how new commands should be prioritized against the existing state in the adapter. The columns describe how to service the existing state when the new command comes in.

Connection Quality (EAP) - Priority 1
P2P Listen - Priority 2
Connection Quality Latency (Media Streaming) - Priority 3
Existing Connections - Priority 4
Scan/P2P Discovery (forced)
