# CreateIpForwardEntry2 function

The **CreateIpForwardEntry2** function creates a new IP route entry on a local computer.

## Syntax

``` c++
NETIOAPI_API CreateIpForwardEntry2(
  _In_Â const MIB_IPFORWARD_ROW2 *Row
);
```

## Parameters

- *Row* \[in\]  
   A pointer to a [**MIB\_IPFORWARD\_ROW2**](mib-ipforward-row2.md) structure entry for an IP route entry.

## Return value

**CreateIpForwardEntry2** returns STATUS\_SUCCESS if the function succeeds.

If the function fails, **CreateIpForwardEntry2** returns one of the following error codes:

## Remarks

The **CreateIpForwardEntry2** function is used to add a new neighbor IP address entry on a local computer. Use the [**InitializeIpForwardEntry**](initializeipforwardentry.md) function to initialize the members of a [**MIB\_IPFORWARD\_ROW2**](mib-ipforward-row2.md) structure entry with default values. A driver can then change the members in the MIB\_IPFORWARD\_ROW2 entry that it wants to modify and then call **CreateIpForwardEntry2**.

Your driver must initialize the following members of the MIB\_IPFORWARD\_ROW2 structure that the *Row* parameter points to:

- Set **DestinationPrefix** to a valid IPv4 or IPv6 address prefix.

- Set **NextHop** to a valid IPv4 or IPv6 address and family.

- Set **InterfaceLuid** or **InterfaceIndex** to the LUID or index value of the interface.

The **InterfaceLuid** and **InterfaceIndex** members are used in the order that is listed earlier. So if the **InterfaceLuid** is specified, this member is used to determine the interface to add the IP route entry on. If no value was set for the **InterfaceLuid** member (the value of this member was set to zero), the **InterfaceIndex** member is next used to determine the interface.

The route metric offset that is specified in the **Metric** member of the MIB\_IPFORWARD\_ROW2 structure that the *Row* parameter points to represents only part of the complete route metric. The complete metric is a combination of this route metric offset added to the interface metric that is specified in the **Metric** member of the [**MIB\_IPINTERFACE\_ROW**](mib-ipinterface-row.md) structure of the associated interface. A driver can retrieve the interface metric by calling the [**GetIpInterfaceEntry**](getipinterfaceentry.md) function.

The **Age** and **Origin** members of the MIB\_IPFORWARD\_ROW2 structure that the *Row* parameter points to are ignored when the **CreateIpForwardEntry2** function is called. These members are set by the network stack and cannot be set by using the **CreateIpForwardEntry2** function.

The **CreateIpForwardEntry2** function fails if the **DestinationPrefix** and **NextHop** members of the MIB\_IPFORWARD\_ROW2 structure that the *Row* parameter points to are a duplicate of an existing IP route entry on the interface that is specified in the **InterfaceLuid** or **InterfaceIndex** members.
