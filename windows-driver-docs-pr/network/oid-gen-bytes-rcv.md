# OID\_GEN\_BYTES\_RCV


As a query, NDIS and overlying drivers use the OID\_GEN\_BYTES\_RCV OID to determine the total number of bytes that a miniport adapter received.

**Version Information**

<a href="" id="windows-vista-and-later-versions-of-windows"></a>Windows Vista and later versions of Windows  
Supported.

<a href="" id="ndis-6-0-and-later-miniport-drivers"></a>NDIS 6.0 and later miniport drivers  
Not requested. (see Remarks section)

## Remarks

NDIS handles this OID for miniport drivers. See the [OID\_GEN\_STATISTICS](oid-gen-statistics.md) OID for more information about statistics.

The total byte count is the sum of the receive-directed byte count, receive-multicast byte count and receive-broadcast byte count. This value is the same as the sum of the values that are returned by the [OID\_GEN\_DIRECTED\_BYTES\_RCV](oid-gen-directed-bytes-rcv.md), [OID\_GEN\_MULTICAST\_BYTES\_RCV](oid-gen-multicast-bytes-rcv.md), and [OID\_GEN\_BROADCAST\_BYTES\_RCV](oid-gen-broadcast-bytes-rcv.md) OIDs.

The count is identical to the *ifInOctets* counter described in RFC 2863.
