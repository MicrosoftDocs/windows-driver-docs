# IPsec Task Offload Version 2 in NDIS 6.1

\[The IPsec Task Offload feature is deprecated and should not be used.\]




IPsec task offload provides offloading services for IPsec network data processing to IPsec offload-capable network interface cards (NICs). NDIS 6.1 and later support IPsec offload version 2 (IPsecOV2). IPsecOV2 extends support for additional crypto-algorithms, IPv6, and co-existence with large send offload (LSO).

IPsecOV2 uses the NDIS 6.1 direct OID request interface. For more information about the direct OID request interface, see [Direct OID Request Interface in NDIS 6.1](direct-oid-request-interface-in-ndis-6-1.md).

For more information about IPsecOV2, see [IPsec Offload Version 2](./introduction-to-ipsec-offload-version-2.md).
