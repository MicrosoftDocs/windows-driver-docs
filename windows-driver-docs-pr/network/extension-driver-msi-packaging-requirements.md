# Extension Driver MSI Packaging Requirements


Switch extensions must be packaged in a silently installable MSI file. This file can then be deployed to the computer where the extensions are used by management applications automatically.

The MSI file must meet the following requirements:

-   Drivers must be packaged and distributed in the standard MSI package format.
-   The MSI package must be silently uninstallable.
-   The MSI package can contain only one extension.
-   The MSI package must contain the required table fields described in the MSI table fields listed below. In addition, the MSI file must be able to silently install the driver .sys, .inf and any supplemental files required for the driver to operate using the parameters described in the *DriverInstallParams* field of the MSI Properties table fields list below.

| Field                           | Required | Type       | Details                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| **MaxApplicableOSVersion**      | Optional | **String** | The maximum version of the Windows operating system that this extension will run on. See [Operating System Version](/windows/desktop/SysInfo/operating-system-version) for operating system version numbers. Note that the Hyper-V Extensible Switch feature was added in Windows Server 2012, so the lowest valid value for this field is "6.2" or the value of **MinApplicableOSVersion**, whichever is higher. This field is optional. If no value is specified, the extension will run on **MinApplicableOSVersion** and later. |
