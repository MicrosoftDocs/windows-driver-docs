# NDIS\_STATUS\_WWAN\_PACKET\_SERVICE


Miniport drivers use the NDIS\_STATUS\_WWAN\_PACKET\_SERVICE notification to inform the MB Service when packet service availability changes, including to notify of a change to the type of packet data service currently used.

Miniport drivers can also send unsolicited events with this notification.

This notification uses the [**NDIS\_WWAN\_PACKET\_SERVICE\_STATE**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ndiswwan/ns-ndiswwan-_ndis_wwan_packet_service_state) structure.

## Remarks

CDMA-based miniport drivers can automatically initiate packet-attach service if there is no resource allocation/release is possible and can send the event notification to the MB Service.

Miniport drivers should obey the following guidelines for event notifications:

-   Miniport drivers should set **AvailableDataClasses** is set to WWAN\_DATA\_CLASS\_NONE during miniport driver initialization. Thereafter, miniport drivers must notify the MB Service whenever there is any change to **AvailableDataClasses**.

-   Miniport drivers should set **CurrentDataClass** to WWAN\_DATA\_CLASS\_NONE during miniport driver initialization. Thereafter, miniport drivers must notify the MB Service whenever there is any change to **CurrentDataClass** . Miniport drivers should send an NDIS\_STATUS\_LINK\_STATE notification if the change to **CurrentDataClass** results in a change of the transmit or receive link speed.

-   Miniport drivers must notify the MB Service whenever there is any change in Packet Service attach state.

Miniport drivers should return *query* results according to the following rules:

-   Miniport drivers must return WWAN\_STATUS\_SUCCESS with **WwanPacketServiceStateAttaching** whenever the device attempts to packet-attach.

-   Miniport drivers should return WWAN\_STATUS\_SUCCESS with **WwanPacketServiceStateDetaching** whenever the device attempts to packet-detach.

-   When the device is in final state, miniport drivers should return WWAN\_STATUS\_SUCCESS along with the appropriate current state ( **WwanPacketServiceStateAttached** or **WwanPacketServiceStateDetached**)

-   Miniport drivers must list all the available data-classes; not just the highest data-class available. This applies to both *query* operations as well as event notifications.

Miniport drivers should return *set* results according to the following rules:

-   Return WWAN\_STATUS\_SUCCESS, if *set* request with **WwanPacketServiceActionAttach**, is issued by the Service and the device is already in the packet-attached state.

-   Return WWAN\_STATUS\_SUCCESS, if *set* request with **WwanPacketServiceActionDetach**, is issued by the Service and the device is already in the packet-detached state.

-   Never return transient states for the *set* request. Only the final states **WwanPacketServiceStateAttached** or **WwanPacketServiceStateDetached** must be returned after the successful completion of the packet service operation with WWAN\_STATUS\_SUCCESS
