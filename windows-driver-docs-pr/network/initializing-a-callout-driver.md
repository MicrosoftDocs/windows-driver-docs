# Initializing a Callout Driver


A callout driver initializes itself within its [**DriverEntry**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff544113) function. The main initialization tasks are as follows:

-   [Specifying an Unload Function](specifying-an-unload-function.md)

-   [Creating a Device Object](creating-a-device-object.md)

-   [Registering Callouts with the Filter Engine](registering-callouts-with-the-filter-engine.md)
