# Starting and Pausing a Miniport Adapter Overview





NDIS pauses an adapter to stop data flow that could interfere with Plug and Play operations, such as adding or removing a filter driver, or requests, such as setting a packet filter or multicast address list on the NIC. For more information about how to modify a running driver stack, see [Modifying a Running Driver Stack](modifying-a-running-driver-stack.md).

NDIS restarts an adapter from the Paused state. The adapter enters the Paused start after adapter initialization is complete or after a pause operation is complete.

The following topics provide more information about starting and pausing and adapter:

-   [Pausing an Adapter](pausing-an-adapter.md)
