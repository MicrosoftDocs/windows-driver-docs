# Managing OID Requests to Physical Network Adapters


This section discusses how Hyper-V extensible switch extensions manage object identifier (OID) requests for underlying physical network adapters over the extensible switch control path.

This section includes the following topics:

[Forwarding OID Requests to Physical Network Adapters](forwarding-oid-requests-to-physical-network-adapters.md)

[Managing Hardware Offload OID Requests to Physical Network Adapters](managing-hardware-offload-oid-requests-to-physical-network-adapters.md)

For more information on how to manage OID requests over the Hyper-V extensible switch control path, see [Hyper-V Extensible Switch Control Path for OID Requests](hyper-v-extensible-switch-control-path-for-oid-requests.md).
