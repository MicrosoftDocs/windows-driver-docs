# Introduction to NDIS Protocol Drivers


An NDIS protocol driver exports a set of *ProtocolXxx* functions at its lower edge. Such a protocol driver communicates with NDIS to send and receive network data. The protocol driver binds to an underlying miniport driver or intermediate driver that exports a *MiniportXxx* interface at its upper edge.

**Note**  The miniport driver upper edge of an intermediate driver (virtual miniport) does not manage physical devices. Underlying miniport drivers manage physical devices.

 

Protocol drivers always use NDIS-provided functions to communicate with underlying NDIS drivers to send and receive network data. For example, a protocol driver that has a connectionless lower-edge (which communicates with underlying drivers for connectionless media, such as Ethernet) must call [**NdisSendNetBufferLists**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ndis/nf-ndis-ndissendnetbufferlists) to send network data to an underlying NDIS driver. The protocol driver can call [**NdisOidRequest**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ndis/nf-ndis-ndisoidrequest) to query or set OIDs that underlying connectionless drivers support. A protocol driver that has a connection-oriented lower edge (which communicates with underlying drivers for connection-oriented media, such as ISDN) must call [**NdisCoSendNetBufferLists**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ndis/nf-ndis-ndiscosendnetbufferlists) to send network data to a lower-level NDIS driver. It can also call [**NdisCoOidRequest**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ndis/nf-ndis-ndiscooidrequest) to query or set OIDs that are supported by underlying connection-oriented drivers.

NDIS also provides a set of **Ndis<em>Xxx</em>** functions that hide the details of the underlying operating system. For example, a protocol driver can call [**NdisInitializeEvent**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ndis/nf-ndis-ndisinitializeevent) to create an event for synchronization purposes and [**NdisInitializeListHead**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ndis/nf-ndis-ndisinitializelisthead) to create a linked list. Protocol drivers that use the NDIS versions of such functions are more portable across Microsoft operating systems. However, protocol drivers can also call kernel-mode support routines, such as [**IoCreateDevice**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-iocreatedevice). For more information, see [Summary of Kernel-Mode Support Routines](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/index).

Developers of protocol drivers should use the same [programming considerations](network-driver-programming-considerations.md) that are applied to other NDIS drivers.
