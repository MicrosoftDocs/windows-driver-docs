# Hyper-V Extensible Switch Control Path


This section discusses the control path that Hyper-V extensible switch object identifier (OID) requests and NDIS status indications move across.

This section includes the following topics:

[Hyper-V Extensible Switch Control Path for OID Requests](hyper-v-extensible-switch-control-path-for-oid-requests.md)

[Hyper-V Extensible Switch Control Path for NDIS Status Indications](hyper-v-extensible-switch-control-path-for-ndis-status-indications.md)

**Note**  In the extensible switch interface, NDIS filter drivers are known as *extensible switch extensions* and the driver stack is known as the *extensible switch driver stack*.
