# Enabling Wake-Up Events





A protocol driver can send an [OID\_PNP\_ENABLE\_WAKE\_UP](./oid-pnp-enable-wake-up.md) request to enable one or more of the network adapter's wake-up capabilities. NDIS does not immediately enable these wake-up capabilities. Instead, NDIS keeps track of the wake-up capabilities that are enabled by the protocol driver and, just before the miniport driver transitions to a sleeping state, sends an OID\_PNP\_ENABLE\_WAKE\_UP to the miniport driver to enable the appropriate wake-up events. After the miniport driver initializes the network adapter, or when it resumes from a low-power state, the miniport driver must disable any wake up methods that are set on the network adapter.

Before the miniport driver transitions to a low-power state (that is, before NDIS sends the miniport driver an OID\_PNP\_SET\_POWER request), NDIS sends the miniport driver an OID\_PNP\_ENABLE\_WAKE\_UP request to enable the network adapter's wake-up capabilities.
