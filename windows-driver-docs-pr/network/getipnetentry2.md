# GetIpNetEntry2 function

The **GetIpNetEntry2** function retrieves information for a neighbor IP address entry on the local computer.

## Syntax

``` c++
NETIOAPI_API GetIpNetEntry2(
  _Inout_Â PMIB_IPNET_ROW2 Row
);
```

## Parameters

- *Row* \[in, out\]  
   A pointer to a [**MIB\_IPNET\_ROW2**](mib-ipnet-row2.md) structure entry for a neighbor IP address entry. On successful return, this structure is updated with the properties for neighbor IP address.

## Return value

**GetIpNetEntry2** returns STATUS\_SUCCESS if the function succeeds.

If the function fails, **GetIpNetEntry2** returns one of the following error codes:

<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Return code</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER</strong></td>
<td><p>An invalid parameter was passed to the function. This error is returned if a <strong>NULL</strong> pointer is passed in the <em>Row</em> parameter, the <strong>Address</strong> member of the <a href="mib-ipnet-row2.md"><strong>MIB_IPNET_ROW2</strong></a> structure that the <em>Row</em> parameter points to was not set to a valid neighbor IPv4 or IPv6 address, or both <strong>InterfaceLuid</strong> and <strong>InterfaceIndex</strong> members of the MIB_IPNET_ROW2 structure were unspecified.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><strong>STATUS_NOT_FOUND</strong></td>
<td><p>The specified interface could not be found. This error is returned if the function cannot find the network interface that is specified by the <strong>InterfaceLuid</strong> or <strong>InterfaceIndex</strong> member of the MIB_IPNET_ROW2 structure that the <em>Row</em> parameter points to.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>STATUS_NOT_SUPPORTED</strong></td>
<td><p>The request is not supported. This error is returned if no IPv4 stack is located on the local computer and an IPv4 address was specified in the <strong>Address</strong> member of the MIB_IPNET_ROW2 structure that the <em>Row</em> parameter points to, or if no IPv6 stack is located on the local computer and an IPv6 address was specified in the <strong>Address</strong> member.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><strong>Other</strong></td>
<td><p>Use the <a href="/windows/win32/api/winbase/nf-winbase-formatmessage">FormatMessage</a> function to obtain the message string for the returned error.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

## Remarks

The **GetIpNetEntry2** function is used to retrieve a [**MIB\_IPNET\_ROW2**](mib-ipnet-row2.md) structure entry.

On input, your driver must initialize the following members of the MIB\_IPNET\_ROW2 structure that the *Row* parameter points to.

- **Address**  
   Set to a valid neighbor IPv4 or IPv6 address and family.

- **InterfaceLuid** or **InterfaceIndex**  
   These members are used in the order that is listed earlier. So if **InterfaceLuid** is specified, this member is used to determine the interface. If no value was set for the **InterfaceLuid** member (the value of this member was set to zero), the **InterfaceIndex** member is next used to determine the interface.

On output, when the call is successful, **GetIpNetEntry2** retrieves the other properties for the neighbor IP address and fills in the MIB\_IPNET\_ROW2 structure that the *Row* parameter points to.

Your driver can call the [**GetIpNetTable2**](getipnettable2.md) function to enumerate the neighbor IP address entries on a local computer.
