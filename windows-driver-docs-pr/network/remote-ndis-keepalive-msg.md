# REMOTE\_NDIS\_KEEPALIVE\_MSG


The host sends this message periodically when there has been no other control or data traffic from the device to the host for the bus-defined *KeepAliveTimeoutPeriod*. This message is sent by the host at least every RNDIS\_KEEPALIVE\_TIMEOUT seconds, in the absence of other message traffic, to detect the state of the remote device. The remote device may use the same message in the reverse direction, but it is not required.

## Remarks

The host will not send a REMOTE\_NDIS\_KEEPALIVE\_MSG message until RNDIS\_KEEPALIVE\_TIMEOUT seconds have elapsed since the last message received from the remote device. This avoids unnecessary exchange of keep-alive messages when the communication channel is active.

The device can optionally send this message to the host as well. For example, the device may use this message to trigger a response from the host for computing round-trip delay time. If implemented, the device must send REMOTE\_NDIS\_KEEPALIVE\_MSG through the control channel and only when the device is in a state initialized by Remote NDIS.

The host sends a **REMOTE\_NDIS\_KEEPALIVE\_MSG** message to the device through the control channel to check the health of the device. When the device is in a state initialized by Remote NDIS, the host sends this message periodically when there has been no other control or data traffic from the device to the host for the *KeepAliveTimeoutPeriod*. *KeepAliveTimeoutPeriod* is bus-dependent and is defined in the appropriate bus-mapping specifications.

Upon receiving this message, the remote device must return a response whose *Status* field indicates whether the device solicits a [**REMOTE\_NDIS\_RESET\_MSG**](remote-ndis-reset-msg.md) message from the host.

The device does not have to perform any specific action if it stops seeing **REMOTE\_NDIS\_KEEPALIVE\_MSG** messages from the host.
