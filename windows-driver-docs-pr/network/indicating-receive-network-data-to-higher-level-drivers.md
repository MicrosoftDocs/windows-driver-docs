# Indicating Receive Network Data to Higher Level Drivers





A connectionless intermediate driver indicates receive network data to the next higher driver by calling the [**NdisMIndicateReceiveNetBufferLists**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ndis/nf-ndis-ndismindicatereceivenetbufferlists) function. A connection-oriented intermediate driver indicates receive network data to the next higher driver by calling the [**NdisMCoIndicateReceiveNetBufferLists**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ndis/nf-ndis-ndismcoindicatereceivenetbufferlists) function.

Before indicating the receive network data, the driver processes the data, perhaps converting it to the format expected by a higher-level driver, and if required, copying relevant data into MDLs that are associated with an intermediate-driver-allocated [**NET\_BUFFER**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/nbl/ns-nbl-net_buffer) structure.
