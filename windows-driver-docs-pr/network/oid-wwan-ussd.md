# OID\_WWAN\_USSD


OID\_WWAN\_USSD sends Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD) requests to the underlying MB device.

Query requests are not supported.

Miniport drivers must process set requests asynchronously, initially returning NDIS\_STATUS\_INDICATION\_REQUIRED to the original request, and later sending an [NDIS\_STATUS\_WWAN\_USSD](./ndis-status-wwan-ussd.md) status notification containing the status of the initial USSD request when they have completed the transaction.

Windows does not send an OID\_WWAN\_USSD request to a miniport driver if a previous request is still in progress, with the exception of a request to cancel a pending operation by setting the [WWAN\_USSD\_REQUEST](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wwan/ns-wwan-_wwan_ussd_request) **RequestType** member of the request to *WwanUssdRequestCancel*.

When a request is canceled, the miniport driver must respond to both the canceled request and the cancel request.
