# System Area Networks





A *system area network* (SAN) is a group of devices that are linked by a high-speed, high-performance connection. A SAN connection uses Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, which are assigned by TCP/IP to each SAN network interface controller (NIC), to determine data routing. It also uses a reliable transport, which is built into the SAN, to perform data delivery. A SAN can include, for example, clusters of client and server computers.
