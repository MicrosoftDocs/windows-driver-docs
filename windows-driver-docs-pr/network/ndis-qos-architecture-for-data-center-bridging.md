The unshaded boxes in the diagram represent components that the Windows operating system provides, including components that support DCB. For more information about these components, see [System-Provided DCB Components](system-provided-dcb-components.md).

The shaded boxes in the diagram represent DCB components that independent hardware vendors (IHVs) and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) provide. For more information about these components, see [Vendor-Provided DCB Components](vendor-provided-dcb-components.md).
