# OID\_RECEIVE\_FILTER\_CURRENT\_CAPABILITIES


Overlying drivers issue OID query requests of OID\_RECEIVE\_FILTER\_CURRENT\_CAPABILITIES to obtain the currently enabled receive filtering capabilities of a network adapter.

After a successful return from the OID query request, the **InformationBuffer** member of the [**NDIS\_OID\_REQUEST**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/oidrequest/ns-oidrequest-ndis_oid_request) structure contains a pointer to an [**NDIS\_RECEIVE\_FILTER\_CAPABILITIES**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ntddndis/ns-ntddndis-_ndis_receive_filter_capabilities) structure.

## Remarks

NDIS receive filters are used in the following NDIS interfaces:

-   [NDIS Packet Coalescing](./ndis-packet-coalescing.md). For more information about how to use receive filters in this interface, see [Managing Packet Coalescing Receive Filters](./guidelines-for-managing-packet-coalescing-receive-filters.md).

-   [Single Root I/O Virtualization (SR-IOV)](./single-root-i-o-virtualization--sr-iov-.md). For more information about how to use receive filters in this interface, see [Setting a Receive Filter on a Virtual Port](./setting-a-receive-filter-on-a-virtual-port.md).

-   [Virtual Machine Queue (VMQ)](./virtual-machine-queue--vmq--in-ndis-6-20.md). For more information about how to use receive filters in this interface, see [Setting and Clearing VMQ Filters](./setting-and-clearing-vmq-filters.md).

Starting with NDIS 6.20, miniport drivers register the currently enabled receive filtering hardware capabilities of the network adapter when its [*MiniportInitializeEx*](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ndis/nc-ndis-miniport_initialize) function is called. Miniport drivers register these capabilities by following these steps:

1.  The driver initializes an [**NDIS\_RECEIVE\_FILTER\_CAPABILITIES**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ntddndis/ns-ntddndis-_ndis_receive_filter_capabilities) structure with the currently enabled receive filtering hardware capabilities.

2.  The driver initializes an [**NDIS\_MINIPORT\_ADAPTER\_HARDWARE\_ASSIST\_ATTRIBUTES**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ndis/ns-ndis-_ndis_miniport_adapter_hardware_assist_attributes) structure and sets the **CurrentReceiveFilterCapabilities** member to a pointer to the [**NDIS\_RECEIVE\_FILTER\_CAPABILITIES**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ntddndis/ns-ntddndis-_ndis_receive_filter_capabilities) structure.

3.  The miniport driver calls the [**NdisMSetMiniportAttributes**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ndis/nf-ndis-ndismsetminiportattributes) function and sets the *MiniportAttributes* parameter to a pointer to an [**NDIS\_MINIPORT\_ADAPTER\_HARDWARE\_ASSIST\_ATTRIBUTES**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ndis/ns-ndis-_ndis_miniport_adapter_hardware_assist_attributes) structure.

Overlying protocol and filter drivers do not have to issue OID query requests of OID\_RECEIVE\_FILTER\_CURRENT\_CAPABILITIES. NDIS provides the currently enabled receive filtering capabilities to these drivers in the following way:

-   NDIS provides the currently enabled receive filtering capabilities of an underlying network adapter to overlying protocol drivers in the **ReceiveFilterCapabilities** member of the [**NDIS\_BIND\_PARAMETERS**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ndis/ns-ndis-_ndis_bind_parameters) structure during the bind operation.

-   NDIS provides the currently enabled receive filtering capabilities of an underlying network adapter to overlying filter drivers in the **ReceiveFilterCapabilities** member of the [**NDIS\_FILTER\_ATTACH\_PARAMETERS**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ndis/ns-ndis-_ndis_filter_attach_parameters) structure during the attach operation.

### Return status codes

NDIS handles the OID query request of OID\_RECEIVE\_FILTER\_CURRENT\_CAPABILITIES for miniport drivers, and returns one of the following status codes:

<a href="" id="ndis-status-success"></a>NDIS\_STATUS\_SUCCESS  
The request completed successfully. The **InformationBuffer** points to an [**NDIS\_RECEIVE\_FILTER\_CAPABILITIES**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ntddndis/ns-ntddndis-_ndis_receive_filter_capabilities) structure.

<a href="" id="ndis-status-pending"></a>NDIS\_STATUS\_PENDING  
The request is pending completion. NDIS passes the final status code and results to the OID request completion handler of the caller after the request has completed.

<a href="" id="ndis-status-invalid-length"></a>NDIS\_STATUS\_INVALID\_LENGTH  
The information buffer was too short. NDIS set the **DATA.QUERY\_INFORMATION.BytesNeeded** member in the [**NDIS\_OID\_REQUEST**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/oidrequest/ns-oidrequest-ndis_oid_request) structure to the minimum buffer size that is required.

<a href="" id="ndis-status-not-supported"></a>NDIS\_STATUS\_NOT\_SUPPORTED  
The network adapter does not support receive filtering.

<a href="" id="ndis-status-failure"></a>NDIS\_STATUS\_FAILURE  
The request failed for other reasons.
