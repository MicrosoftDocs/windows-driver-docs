# Filtering condition identifiers

The filtering condition identifiers are each represented by a GUID. These identifiers are described in the following table.

|Filtering condition identifier|Description|
|----|----|
|FWPM_CONDITION_ARRIVAL_INTERFACE_INDEX|The index of the arrival network interface, as enumerated by the network stack.</br>WFP uses the Arrival interface to match this condition. The Arrival Interface is the first interface the packet sees before entering the IP stack inbound from the network, before weak-host or forwarding are performed.</br>This condition is asymmetric for reauthorization purposes, as it is intrinsically an inbound condition. This means that WFP will use an empty value on this condition when reauthorizing an inbound connection on a response outbound packet.</br>To handle reauthorization a second filter must be used. This second filter can either permit or block the empty values, or use a different condition that will have a valid value for such circumstance. In the case of arrival interface conditions, the next hop class of interface conditions will have a valid interface on outbound packets.</br>Note that this is available only in Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows 7, and later versions of Windows.|
|FWPM_CONDITION_ARRIVAL_INTERFACE_TYPE|The type of the arrival network interface, as defined by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). For more information, see [IANAifType-MIB Definitions](https://www.iana.org/assignments/ianaiftype-mib/ianaiftype-mib).</br>WFP uses the Arrival interface to match this condition.
