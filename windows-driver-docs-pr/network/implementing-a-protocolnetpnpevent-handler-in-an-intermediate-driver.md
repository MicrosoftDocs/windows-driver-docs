# Implementing a ProtocolNetPnPEvent Handler in an Intermediate Driver





The implementation of a [*ProtocolNetPnPEvent*](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ndis/nc-ndis-protocol_net_pnp_event) function in intermediate drivers is nearly identical to the implementation in protocol drivers. For more information about implementing a *ProtocolNetPnPEvent* handler in an intermediate driver, see [Handling PnP Events and PM Events in a Protocol Driver](handling-pnp-events-and-power-management-events-in-a-protocol-driver.md).

NDIS intermediate drivers pass on PnP events to higher layer drivers by calling the [**NdisMNetPnPEvent**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ndis/nf-ndis-ndismnetpnpevent) function.
