# MBIMEx 2.0 – 5G NSA support

Because the [MBIM 1.0 errata specification](https://www.usb.org/sites/default/files/MBIM10Errata1_073013.zip) lacks a mechanism to change existing CIDs with new or modified payloads, Windows 10, version 1903 introduces MBIM 1.0 Extension 2.0 to extend the interface to support 5G.

## Versioning scheme

> [!NOTE]
> In this section, the term *MBIMEx version* refers to the MBIM Extensions release number.

The host learns a device's MBIMEx version through two ways:

1. The MBIM EXTENDED FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTOR.
2. The optional MBM_CID_VERSION message, if the device supports it and declares support for it.

If these two are different, the higher version dictates the MBIMEx version for the duration that the device stays enumerated to the host. The higher MBIMEx version is referred to as the device's *announced MBIMEx version*. A device's announced MBIMEx version can be lower than its native MBIMEx version, which is the highest MBIMEx version that the device supports. Devices can learn the host's MBIMEx version explicitly only via the MBIM_CID_VERSION message.

In any release, the host always queries the device for supported services and CIDs using MBIM_CID_DEVICE_SERVICES at the beginning of the device initialization sequence. 

If a device supports MBIM_CID_VERSION and advertises its support in the MBIM_CID_DEVICE_SERVICES query response, then a host that does not understand MBIM_CID_VERSION or has an MBIMEx version lower than 2.0 ignores it. Meanwhile, a host that does understand MBIM_CID_VERSION and has a native MBIMEx version of 2.0 or higher sends a MBIM_CID_VERSION message to the device with the host's native MBIMEx version, and the CID is the first CID that is sent to the device after receiving the MBIM_CID_DEVICE_SERVICES response.

If the first CID that the device receives from the host after it responds to the MBIM_CID_DEVICE_SERVICES query is MBIM_CID_VERSION, the device knows the host's MBIMEx version. 

If the first CID that the device receives from the host after it responds to the MBIM_CID_DEVICE_SERVICES query is any other CID, then the device assumes that the host's native MBIMEx version is 1.0.

If the device doesn't support MBIM_CID_VERSION, it will not respond to the MBIM_CID_DEVICE_SERVICES query with MBIM_CID_VERSION.
Therefore the host will not send a MBIM_CID_VERSION message and assumes that the device's native MBIMEx version is 1.0.

:::image type="content" source="images\mbim_CID_versioning_fig2.png" alt-text="Diagram showing OS with highest MBIMEx version 3.0 and modem without MBIM_CID_VERSION support.":::


Feature-wise, a higher MBIMEx version is a superset of all lower MBIMEx versions. A host supports all devices with an announced MBIMEx version at or below the host's native MBIMEx version. If a device's announced MBIMEx version is higher than a host's native MBIMEx version, the host is not expected to support the device and the exact behavior of the host in this situation is undefined.

A device that intends to work with older hosts should initially advertise MBIMEx version 1.0 or the lowest host MBIMEx version with which the device is intended to work in an MBIM extended functional descriptor.

If the host sends MBIM_CID_VERSION with a higher MBIMEx version than the device initially advertised, then the device should indicate a higher MBIMEx version in the MBIM_CID_VERSION response up to the smaller of the host's native MBIMEx version and the device's native MBIMEx version.

> [!NOTE]
> For example, a device supports MBIMEx version 2.0, but is intended to work with older versions of the OS that do not support MBIMEx 2.0. The device initially advertises MBIMEx version 1.0 in the USB descriptors and advertises support for the optional MBIM_CID_VERSION. When inserted into a host running Windows 10, version 1803, the host does not understand MBIM_CID_VERSION and does not send MBIM_CID_VERSION to the device. To the host, the device's MBIMEx version is 1.0. The host continues to send other CIDs in the initialization sequence. Upon receiving CIDs other than MBIM_CID_VERSION, the device knows that the host supports MBIMEx version 1.0. Both sides proceed to conform to MBIMEx version 1.0. Later, when the same device is inserted into a host running Windows 10, version 1903 with a native MBIMEx version of 2.0, the host sends MBIM_CID_VERSION to the device to inform it that the host's native MBIMEx version is 2.0. The device sends MBIM_CID_VERSION back in response with the device's announced MBIMEx version 2.0. From there, both sides proceed to conform to MBIMEx version 2.0.

The following table shows a compatibility matrix with three hypothetical hosts and three hypothetical devices, each with its native MBIMEx version stated. The devices advertise MBIMEx version 1.0 initially in the USB descriptor. The matrix shows how each of the devices behaves with each of the hosts.

| Device (below) / Host (right) | Windows 10, version 1809 or earlier (native MBIMEx version 1.0) | Windows 10, version 1903 and later (MBIMEx version 2.0) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 4G device <p>Native MBIMEx version 1.0</p> | Device initially advertises MBIMEx 1.0. No MBIM_CID_VERSION exchange. Compatible device and host. Works by default with MBIMEx version 1.0. | Device initially advertises MBIMEx 1.0. No MBIM_CID_VERSION exchange. The host works with the device using MBIMEx 1.0. |
| 5G NSA device <p>Native MBIMEx version 2.0</p> | Device initially advertises MBIMEx 1.0. No MBIM_CID_VERSION exchange. Device knows that the host has MBIMEx 1.0 and proceeds with MBIMEx 1.0. | Device initially advertises MBIMEx 1.0. Host sends MBIM_CID_VERSION to inform the device that the host supports MBIMEx 2.0. Device responds with MBIMEx 2.0. Both sides proceed with MBIMEx 2.0. |

The following table lists all existing CIDs that are modified in MBIMEx version 2.0, and their modified payloads. All unmentioned payloads in these CIDs and all other CIDs not mentioned in the table carry over from MBIMEx version 1.0 and remain unchanged. 

| CID | Payload |

| MBIM_CID_REGISTER_STATE | MBIM_REGISTRATION_STATE_INFO_V2 |
| MBIM_CID_PACKET_SERVICE | MBIM_PACKET_SERVICE_INFO_V2 |
| MBIM_CID_SIGNAL_STATE | MBIM_SIGNAL_STATE_INFO_V2 |

## MBIM service

| Service name | UUID | UUID value |

| Microsoft Basic IP Connectivity Extensions | UUID_BASIC_CONNECT_EXTENSIONS | 3D01DCC5-FEF5-4D05-9D3A-BEF7058E9AAF |

## MBIM_CID_VERSION

For MBB drivers that support MBIM Microsoft extension 2.0 or above, MBIM_CID_VERSION is a mandatory command for exchanging MBIM version information between the host and the device. For in-market devices with drivers that do not recognize this CID, the host will assume and provide backward compatibility.

The host sends this command as a query if it is supported by the device. The query contains the MBIM release number and MBIM Extensions release number that the host currently supports.

On the device side, the device adjusts its announced MBIM release number and MBIM Extensions release number based on the rules defined in [versioning scheme](#versioning-scheme), then sends them in the response to the host.

This command is defined under the **Basic Connect Extensions** service.

GSM-based carriers might have more than one MNC, and hence more than one **ProviderId**.</p><p>For CDMA-based networks, this string is a five-digit System ID (SID). Generally, a CDMA-based carrier has more than one SID. Typically, a carrier has one SID for each market that is usually divided geographically within a nation by regulations, such as Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSA) in the United States. CDMA-based devices must specify MBIM_CDMA_DEFAULT_PROVIDER_ID if this information is not available.</p><p>When processing a query request and the registration state is in automatic register mode, this member contains the provider ID with which the device is currently associated (if applicable). When the registration state is in manual register mode, this member contains the provider ID to which the device is requested to register (even if the provider is unavailable).</p><p>When processing a set request and the registration state is in manual mode, this contains the provider ID selected by the host with which to register the device. When the registration state is in automatic register mode, this parameter is ignored.</p><p>CDMA 1xRTT providers must be set to MBIM_CDMA_DEFAULT_PROVIDER_ID if the provider ID is not available.</p> |

### Status Codes

This CID only uses generic status codes defined in Section 9.4.5 of the [MBIM specification revision 1.0](https://www.usb.org/sites/default/files/MBIM10Errata1_073013.zip).

## MBIM_CID_SIGNAL_STATE

This CID is an extension to MBIM_CID_SIGNAL_STATE, introducing RSRP and SNR for signal state criteria. This new extension is only valid if the device indicates support of MBIM Extensions version 2.0. This extension is mandatory if the modem supports MBIMDataClass5G_(N)SA data classes.

The RSRP and SNR fields are only valid if the corresponding SystemType is either MGBIMDataClassLTE or MBIMDataClass5G_(N)SA. IF the modem reports RSRP and/or SNR, then the RSSI field shall be set to a value of **99**.

If the corresponding SystemType is MBIMDataClass5G_(N)SA, the RSRP field is mandatory and the SNR field is optional. If the corresponding SystemType is MBIMDataClassLTE, the RSRP and SNR fields are optional and the RSSI field can be used instead. In this case, the RSRP and SNR fields can be omitted by setting a zero (**0**) value for both **RsrpSnrOffset** and **RsrpSnrSize** members.

### Unsolicited Events

Notifications contain an MBIM_SIGNAL_STATE_INFO_V2 structure.

### Status Codes

This CID only uses generic status codes defined in Section 9.4.5 of the [MBIM specification revision 1.0](https://www.usb.org/sites/default/files/MBIM10Errata1_073013.zip).

## LTE signal bar calculation
:::image type="content" source="images/lte_signal_bar_calc.png" alt-text="Diagram illustrating the process of LTE signal bar calculation.":::

The OS shall process the registry settings for signal strength calculations in the following order: 

Dataclass is CDMA (or its variant) or TDSCDMA

1. If a legacy signal bar mapping table exists under “per_iccid”, use this setting.
2. Else, if a legacy signal bar mapping table exists under “per_device”, use this setting.
3. Else, use the default signal bar mapping table in code. 

Dataclass is GSM or WCDMA

1. If a GSM or WCDMA technology specific signal bar mapping table exists under “per_iccid”, use this setting.
2. Else, if a GSM or WCDMA technology specific signal bar mapping table exists under “per_device”, use this setting.
3. Else, if a legacy signal bar mapping table exists under “per_iccid”, use this setting. 
4. Else, if a legacy signal bar mapping table exists under “per_device”, use this setting. 
5. Else, use the default signal bar mapping table in code.
    1. RSSI >= 17; 5 bars
    1. RSSI >= 12; 4 bars
    1. RSSI >= 7; 3 bars
    1. RSSI >= 4; 2 bars
    1. RSSI >= 2; 1 bars
    1. else; 0 bars

Dataclass is LTE and RSRP is reported by the modem 
1. If a LTE technology specific signal bar mapping table for RSRP exists under “per_iccid”, use this setting. 
2. Else, if a LTE technology specific signal bar mapping table for RSRP exists under “per_device”, use this setting. 
3. Else, use the default LTE RSRP signal bar mapping table in code. 
> [!NOTE]
> If EnableLTESnrReporting is enabled but there is no SNR table for LTE or SNR reporting by the modem, only RSRP is used. Otherwise, the better of RSRP or SNR is converted to signal bars. 

Dataclass is LTE and RSSI is reported by the modem 
1. If a LTE technology specific signal bar mapping table exists under “per_iccid”, use this setting. 
2. Else, if a  LTE technology specific signal bar mapping table exists under “per_device”, use this setting. 
3. Else, if a legacy signal bar mapping table exists under “per_iccid”, use this setting. 
4. Else, if a legacy signal bar mapping table exists under “per_device”, use this setting. 
5. Else, use the default signal bar mapping table in code. 

Dataclass is NR 
1. If a NR technology specific signal bar mapping table for RSRP exists under “per_iccid”, use this setting. 
2. Else, if a NR technology specific signal bar mapping table for RSRP exists under “per_device”, use this setting. 
3. Else, use the default NR RSRP signal bar mapping table in code. 
> [!NOTE]
> If EnableNRSnrReporting is enabled, but no there is no SNR table for NR or SNR reporting by the modem, only RSRP is used. Otherwise, the better of RSRP or SNR is converted to signal bars. 

Dataclass is NSA 
1. If EnableLTEReportingOnNSA is not set or is set to **0**: 
   1. Follow the Dataclass NR flow. 
2. If EnableLTEReportingOnNSA is set to **1**: 
   1. Follow the Dataclass LTE flows (RSRP or RSSI). 
3. If EnableLTEReportingOnNSA is set to **2**:  
   1. If FrequencyRange is FR1, follow the Dataclass LTE flows (RSRP or RSSI). 
   1. If FrequencyRange is <> FR1, follow the Dataclass NR flow. 
4. If EnableLTEReportingOnNSA is set to **3**:  
	1. If FrequencyRange is FR2, follow the Dataclass LTE flows (RSRP or RSSI). 
	1. If FrequencyRange is <> FR2, follow the Dataclass NR flow. 
5. If EnableLTEReportingOnNSA is set to **4**: 
    1. Calculate signal bar using the LTE and NR flows. 
	1. Select the strongest. 
> [!NOTE]
> If the LTE signal is not reported by the modem in 1-5, the NR signal is used. If the NR signal is not used, the LTE signal is applied. 

### COSA customizations for SignalBar calculation

EnableLTEReportingOnNSA:

0 = "Use 5G signal"

1 = "Use LTE signal"

2 = "Use LTE signal if camped on 5G frequency range 1"

3 = "Use LTE signal if camped on 5G frequency range 2"

4 = "Use the strongest signal of LTE and 5G"
 
EnableNRSnrReporting:

0 = "Use only RSRP"

1 = "Use both RSRP and SNR"
 
EnableLTESnrReporting:

0 = "Use only RSRP"

1 = "Use both RSRP and SNR"

|[0,16] |0|
|[17,41] |1|
|[42,51] |2|
|[52,61] |3|
| [62,71] |4|
|[72,126] |5|

If the OEM/MO fails to properly configure the mapping table for SNR or it’s incomplete, use the default mapping:

|SNR|Bars Displayed|
|-|-|
|[0,18] |0|
|[19,38] |1|
