# Setting Information for a Connection-Oriented Miniport Driver





To set an OID that a connection-oriented miniport driver maintains, a bound protocol calls [**NdisCoOidRequest**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ndis/nf-ndis-ndiscooidrequest) and passes an [**NDIS\_OID\_REQUEST**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/oidrequest/ns-oidrequest-ndis_oid_request) structure that specifies the object (OID) that is being queried and that points to a buffer that contains the value to which the object should be set. The call to **NdisCoOidRequest** causes NDIS to call the miniport driver's [**MiniportCoOidRequest**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ndis/nc-ndis-miniport_co_oid_request) function, which sets the object with the supplied value.

The call to **NdisCoOidRequest** can complete synchronously or asynchronously. To complete the call asynchronously, a miniport driver calls [**NdisCoOidRequestComplete**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ndis/nf-ndis-ndiscooidrequestcomplete). The following diagram illustrates setting information in a connection-oriented miniport driver.
