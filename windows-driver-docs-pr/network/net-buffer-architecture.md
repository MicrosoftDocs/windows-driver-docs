# NET\_BUFFER Architecture





This section provides high level information about [**NET\_BUFFER**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/nbl/ns-nbl-net_buffer) structures and related data structures and functions. NET\_BUFFER structures provide an efficient means to package and manage network data.

The following topics are included in this section:

[Network Data Structures](network-data-structures.md)

[Retreat and Advance Operations](retreat-and-advance-operations.md)

[Obtaining Pool Handles](obtaining-pool-handles.md)

[Dispatch IRQL Tracking](dispatch-irql-tracking.md)

[Send and Receive Operations](send-and-receive-operations.md)

[Ethernet Send and Receive Operations](ethernet-send-and-receive-operations.md)
