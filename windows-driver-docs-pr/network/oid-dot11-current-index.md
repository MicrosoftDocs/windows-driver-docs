# OID\_DOT11\_CURRENT\_INDEX


**Important**  The [Native 802.11 Wireless LAN](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff560690) interface is deprecated in Windows 10 and later. Please use the WLAN Device Driver Interface (WDI) instead. For more information about WDI, see [WLAN Universal Windows driver model](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/dn897672).

 

When queried, the OID\_DOT11\_CURRENT\_INDEX object identifier (OID) requests that the miniport driver return the value of the IEEE 802.11 **dot11CurrentIndex** management information base (MIB) object for the current PHY type on the 802.11 station.

This MIB object defines the current index in the hop pattern that the layer management entity (LME) of the PHY uses to determine the current channel number. For more information about how the current channel number is determined, refer to Clause 14.9.2.21 of the IEEE 802.11-2012 standard.

**Note**  Support for OID\_DOT11\_CURRENT\_INDEX is mandatory if the NIC supports the **dot11\_phy\_type\_fhss** PHY type. For more information about how the miniport driver specifies its list of supported PHY types, see [OID\_DOT11\_SUPPORTED\_PHY\_TYPES](oid-dot11-supported-phy-types.md).

 

The data type for OID\_DOT11\_CURRENT\_INDEX is a ULONG value from 1 through 255.

The **dot11CurrentIndex** MIB object is only valid for the frequency-hopping spread spectrum (FHSS) PHY type. If the current PHY type is not set to **dot11\_phy\_type\_fhss**, the miniport driver must fail the query request by returning NDIS\_STATUS\_INVALID\_DATA from its [*MiniportOidRequest*](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff559416) function.

If the miniport driver is operating in Extensible Station (ExtSTA) mode, the current PHY type is determined through the ExtSTA **msDot11CurrentPhyID** MIB object. This MIB object specifies the index of the current PHY type within the 802.11 station's list of supported PHY types. For more information about **msDot11CurrentPhyID**, see [OID\_DOT11\_CURRENT\_PHY\_ID](oid-dot11-current-phy-id.md).

For more information about the 802.11 station's list of supported PHY types, see [OID\_DOT11\_SUPPORTED\_PHY\_TYPES](oid-dot11-supported-phy-types.md).

For more information about the current hop pattern, see [OID\_DOT11\_CURRENT\_PATTERN](oid-dot11-current-pattern.md).

**Note**  A Native 802.11 miniport driver that is designed to run on the Windows Vista or Windows Server 2008 operating systems must always reset this 802.11 MIB OID to its default value. This is the case regardless of the value of the **bSetDefaultMIB** member of the DOT11\_RESET\_REQUEST structure. This requirement applies to a miniport driver that, in a call to the **NdisMSetMiniportAttributes** function, sets **MiniportAttributes** -&gt; **Native\_802\_11\_Attributes** -&gt; **Header** -&gt; **Revision** to NDIS\_MINIPORT\_ADAPTER\_802\_11\_ATTRIBUTES\_REVISION\_1.
