# INF Requirements for NDKPI


The INF file for a miniport driver that supports Network Direct kernel (NDK) must meet the following requirements.

## NDIS upper range value

The miniport driver's INF file must specify an NDIS upper range value of "ndis5" in order for Windows components to discover and use the NDK-capable miniport adapters that are serviced by the driver. This value is specified as follows:

```INF
HKR, Ndi\Interfaces, UpperRange, 0, "ndis5"
```

## *NetworkDirect INF keyword 

The INF file must specify the **\*NetworkDirect** keyword value as follows: 

- Once the driver is installed, administrators can update the **\*NetworkDirect** keyword value in the **Advanced** property page for the adapter. 

**Note**: The miniport driver is automatically restarted after a change is made in the **Advanced** property page for the adapter.

```INF
HKR, Ndi\Params\*NetworkDirect,        ParamDesc,  0, "NetworkDirect Functionality"
HKR, Ndi\Params\*NetworkDirect,        Type,       0, "enum"
HKR, Ndi\Params\*NetworkDirect,        Default,    0, "1"
HKR, Ndi\Params\*NetworkDirect\enum,   "0",        0, "Disabled"
HKR, Ndi\Params\*NetworkDirect\enum,   "1",        0, "Enabled"
```

## *NetworkDirectTechnology INF keyword 

The INF file must specify the **\*NetworkDirectTechnology** keyword value as follows: 

- Once the driver is installed, administrators can update the **\*NetworkDirectTechnology** keyword value in the **Advanced** property page for the adapter. The enumerations are mutually exclusive, meaning  the selection of a NetworkDirectTechnology value excludes all others.  This allows for the Platform to define strict device behavior.  
-   A device must express only the supported transports.  The transport values are identifiers which map to WDK **NDK_RDMA_TECHNOLOGY**.  A redefinition of the identifiers is prohibited.
-   The behavior of devices with multiple concurrent transports is undefined.  The device **must** specify a transport type.

**Note**: The miniport driver is automatically restarted after a change is made in the **Advanced** property page for the adapter.

```INF
HKR, Ndi\Params\*NetworkDirectTechnology,        ParamDesc,  0,  "NetworkDirect Technology"
HKR, Ndi\Params\*NetworkDirectTechnology,        Default,    0,  "1"
HKR, Ndi\Params\*NetworkDirectTechnology,        Type,       0,  "enum"
HKR, Ndi\Params\*NetworkDirectTechnology\enum,   1,          0,  "iWARP"
HKR, Ndi\Params\*NetworkDirectTechnology\enum,   2,          0,  "InfiniBand"
HKR, Ndi\Params\*NetworkDirectTechnology\enum,   3,          0,  "RoCE"
HKR, Ndi\Params\*NetworkDirectTechnology\enum,   4,          0,  "RoCEv2"
HKR, Ndi\Params\*NetworkDirectTechnology,        Optional,   0,  "0"
```

## *NetworkDirectRoCEFrameSize INF keyword  

The INF file for a miniport driver that supports **\*NetworkDirectRoCEFrameSize** must meet the following requirements:

- The **\*NetworkDirectRoCEFrameSize** keyword specifies the administrator requested maximum transmission unit for NetworkDirect communications. Adapters supporting the **\*NetworkDirect** keyword with **RoCE** or **RoCEv2** must additionally support this keyword.

- The acceptable registry values for **\*NetworkDirectRoCEFrameSize** are 256, 512, 1024, 2048, and 4096. The value of 1024 is required. 

- The adapter must use the largest supported size for **\*NetworkDirectRoCEFrameSize** that doesn't exceed **\*JumboPacket**.

- If the configured value of **\*NetworkDirectRoCEFrameSize** differs from the operational (active) RoCE MTU, the driver must log an event in the system event log indicating operational (active) RoCE MTU. 

**Note**: The miniport driver is automatically restarted after a change is made in the **Advanced** property page for the adapter unless the change can be made effective without the restart. 

The following table describes the **\*NetworkDirectRoCEFrameSize** keyword and values that can be edited. The min and max values define the required limits for supported values. An individual adapter can support a lower minimum value or higher maximum value but must support at least these values.


| SubkeyName | ParamDesc | Type | Default value | Min | Max |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **\*NetworkDirectRoCEFrameSize** | Network Direct Maximum Transmission Unit | enum | 1024 | 256 | 4096 |
