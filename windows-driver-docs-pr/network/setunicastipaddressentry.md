# SetUnicastIpAddressEntry function

The **SetUnicastIpAddressEntry** function sets the properties of an existing unicast IP address entry on a local computer.

## Syntax

``` c++
NETIOAPI_API SetUnicastIpAddressEntry(
  _In_Â const MIB_UNICASTIPADDRESS_ROW *Row
);
```

## Parameters

- *Row* \[in\]  
   A pointer to a [**MIB\_UNICASTIPADDRESS\_ROW**](mib-unicastipaddress-row.md) structure entry for an existing unicast IP address entry.

## Return value

**SetUnicastIpAddressEntry** returns STATUS\_SUCCESS if the function succeeds.

If the function fails, **SetUnicastIpAddressEntry** returns one of the following error codes:

<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Return code</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER</strong></td>
<td><p>An invalid parameter was passed to the function. This error is returned if a <strong>NULL</strong> pointer is passed in the <em>Row</em> parameter, the <strong>Address</strong> member of the <a href="mib-unicastipaddress-row.md"><strong>MIB_UNICASTIPADDRESS_ROW</strong></a> structure that the <em>Row</em> parameter points to was not set to a valid unicast IPv4 or IPv6 address, or both <strong>InterfaceLuid</strong> and <strong>InterfaceIndex</strong> members of the MIB_UNICASTIPADDRESS_ROW structure were unspecified.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><strong>STATUS_NOT_FOUND</strong></td>
<td><p>The specified interface could not be found.

</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>STATUS_NOT_SUPPORTED</strong></td>
<td><p>The request is not supported. This error is returned if no IPv4 stack is located on the local computer and an IPv4 address was specified in the <strong>Address</strong> member of the MIB_UNICASTIPADDRESS_ROW structure that the <em>Row</em> parameter points to, or if no IPv6 stack is located on the local computer and an IPv6 address was specified in the <strong>Address</strong> member.</p></td>

## Remarks

The [**GetUnicastIpAddressEntry**](getunicastipaddressentry.md) function is typically used to retrieve an existing [**MIB\_UNICASTIPADDRESS\_ROW**](mib-unicastipaddress-row.md) structure entry to be modified. A driver can then change the members in the MIB\_UNICASTIPADDRESS\_ROW entry that it wants to modify, and then call the **SetUnicastIpAddressEntry** function.

A driver can call the [**InitializeUnicastIpAddressEntry**](initializeunicastipaddressentry.md) function to initialize the members of a MIB\_UNICASTIPADDRESS\_ROW structure entry with default values before making changes. However, the driver typically saves either the **InterfaceLuid** or **InterfaceIndex** member before calling **InitializeUnicastIpAddressEntry** and restores one of these members after the call.

Your driver must initialize the following members of the MIB\_UNICASTIPADDRESS\_ROW structure that the *Row* parameter points to.

- **Address**  
   Set to a valid unicast IPv4 or IPv6 address and family.

- **InterfaceLuid** or **InterfaceIndex**  
   These members are used in the order that is listed earlier. So if **InterfaceLuid** is specified, this member is used to determine the interface. If no value was set for the **InterfaceLuid** member (the value of this member was set to zero), the **InterfaceIndex** member is next used to determine the interface.

If the **OnLinkPrefixLength** member of the MIB\_UNICASTIPADDRESS\_ROW structure that the *Row* parameter points to is set to 255, **SetUnicastIpAddressEntry** sets the unicast IP address properties so that the **OnLinkPrefixLength** member is equal to the length of the IP address. For a unicast IPv4 address, **OnLinkPrefixLength** is set to 32. For a unicast IPv6 address, **OnLinkPrefixLength** is set to 128. If these settings would result in the incorrect subnet mask for an IPv4 address or the incorrect link prefix for an IPv6 address, the driver should set this member to the correct value before calling **SetUnicastIpAddressEntry**.

**SetUnicastIpAddressEntry** ignores the **DadState**, **ScopeId**, and **CreationTimeStamp** members of the MIB\_UNICASTIPADDRESS\_ROW structure that the *Row* parameter points to. These members are set by the network stack and cannot be changed by using the **SetUnicastIpAddressEntry** function. The **ScopeId** member is automatically determined by the interface that the address was added on.
