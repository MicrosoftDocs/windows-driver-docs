# Indicating Miniport Driver Status





Miniport drivers provide status indications to overlying drivers. The CoNDIS status indication functions are similar to the connectionless status indication functions.

To report a change in the status of a connection-oriented NIC or a change in the status of a particular VC active on the NIC, a connection-oriented miniport driver calls [**NdisMCoIndicateStatusEx**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ndis/nf-ndis-ndismcoindicatestatusex). If the miniport driver is reporting a change in the status of a particular VC, it supplies an *NdisVcHandle* that identifies the VC.
