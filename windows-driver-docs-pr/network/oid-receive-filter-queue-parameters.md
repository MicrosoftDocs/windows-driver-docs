# OID\_RECEIVE\_FILTER\_QUEUE\_PARAMETERS


Overlying drivers issue object identifier (OID) method requests of OID\_RECEIVE\_FILTER\_QUEUE\_PARAMETERS to obtain the current configuration parameters of a receive queue. The **InformationBuffer** member of the [**NDIS\_OID\_REQUEST**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/oidrequest/ns-oidrequest-ndis_oid_request) structure contains a pointer to an [**NDIS\_RECEIVE\_QUEUE\_PARAMETERS**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ntddndis/ns-ntddndis-_ndis_receive_queue_parameters) structure with a queue identifier of type **NDIS\_RECEIVE\_QUEUE\_ID**. After a successful return from the OID method request, the **InformationBuffer** member of the **NDIS\_OID\_REQUEST** structure contains a pointer to an **NDIS\_RECEIVE\_QUEUE\_PARAMETERS** structure.

Overlying drivers issue OID set requests of OID\_RECEIVE\_FILTER\_QUEUE\_PARAMETERS to change the current configuration parameters of a queue. The overlying driver provides a pointer to an [**NDIS\_RECEIVE\_QUEUE\_PARAMETERS**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ntddndis/ns-ntddndis-_ndis_receive_queue_parameters) structure in the **InformationBuffer** member of the [**NDIS\_OID\_REQUEST**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/oidrequest/ns-oidrequest-ndis_oid_request) structure.

## Remarks

Overlying drivers issue OID set requests of OID\_RECEIVE\_FILTER\_QUEUE\_PARAMETERS to change the parameters of one or more receive queues. The OID set request is optional for NDIS 6.20 and later miniport drivers. However, the OID request is mandatory for miniport drivers that support the virtual machine queue (VMQ) interface.

**Note**  Only the overlying driver that allocated the queue can change the configuration parameters by issuing OID set requests of OID\_RECEIVE\_FILTER\_QUEUE\_PARAMETERS.

 

The overlying driver obtained the queue identifier input value from an earlier [OID\_RECEIVE\_FILTER\_ALLOCATE\_QUEUE](oid-receive-filter-allocate-queue.md) method OID request.

After the overlying driver allocates a queue, it can change the configuration parameters that have a corresponding change flag (NDIS\_RECEIVE\_QUEUE\_PARAMETER\_*Xxx*\_CHANGED) in the **Flags** member of the [**NDIS\_RECEIVE\_QUEUE\_PARAMETERS**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ntddndis/ns-ntddndis-_ndis_receive_queue_parameters) structure. However, after the queue has been allocated, the overlying driver cannot change the configuration parameters that do not have a corresponding change flag.

### Return Status Codes

NDIS handles the OID method request of OID\_RECEIVE\_FILTER\_QUEUE\_PARAMETERS for miniport drivers, and returns one of the following status codes.
