# NDIS\_STATUS\_RECEIVE\_FILTER\_QUEUE\_PARAMETERS


The **NDIS\_STATUS\_RECEIVE\_FILTER\_QUEUE\_PARAMETERS** status indicates to NDIS and overlying drivers that the current virtual machine (VM) queue parameters have changed on the network adapter.

## Remarks

The miniport driver must issue an **NDIS\_STATUS\_RECEIVE\_FILTER\_QUEUE\_PARAMETERS** status indication when the current VM queue parameters have changed on the network adapter. The VM queue parameters could change when one of the following conditions is true:

-   The VM queue parameters are changed through a management application developed by the independent hardware vendor (IHV).

-   The VM queue parameters change for one or more network adapters that belong to a load balancing failover (LBFO) team managed by a MUX intermediate driver. For more information, see [NDIS MUX Intermediate Drivers](./ndis-mux-intermediate-drivers.md).

When the miniport driver issues the **NDIS\_STATUS\_RECEIVE\_FILTER\_QUEUE\_PARAMETERS** status indication, it must follow these steps:

1.  The miniport driver initializes an [**NDIS\_RECEIVE\_QUEUE\_PARAMETERS**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ntddndis/ns-ntddndis-_ndis_receive_queue_parameters) structure with the current VM queue parameters on the network adapter. The driver must also set the **Flags** member of this structure with the appropriate NDIS\_RECEIVE\_QUEUE\_PARAMETERS\_*Xxx*\_CHANGED flags to report on **NDIS\_RECEIVE\_QUEUE\_PARAMETERS** member values that have changed.

    **Note**  Starting with NDIS 6.30, the miniport driver can only issue an **NDIS\_STATUS\_RECEIVE\_FILTER\_QUEUE\_PARAMETERS** status indication to report on changes to the **InterruptCoalescingDomainId** member.




When the miniport driver initializes the **Header** member of this structure, it sets the **Type** member of **Header** to NDIS\_OBJECT\_TYPE\_DEFAULT. The miniport driver sets the **Revision** member of **Header** to NDIS\_RECEIVE\_QUEUE\_PARAMETERS\_REVISION\_2 and the **Size** member to NDIS\_SIZEOF\_RECEIVE\_QUEUE\_PARAMETERS\_REVISION\_2.


2.  The miniport driver initializes an [**NDIS\_STATUS\_INDICATION**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ndis/ns-ndis-_ndis_status_indication) structure in the following way:

    -   The **StatusCode** member must be set to **NDIS\_STATUS\_RECEIVE\_FILTER\_QUEUE\_PARAMETERS**.

    -   The **StatusBuffer** member must be set to the pointer to a [**NDIS\_RECEIVE\_QUEUE\_PARAMETERS**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ntddndis/ns-ntddndis-_ndis_receive_queue_parameters) structure. This structure contains the currently enabled hardware capabilities of the NIC switch.

    -   The **StatusBufferSize** member must be set to sizeof([**NDIS\_RECEIVE\_QUEUE\_PARAMETERS**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ntddndis/ns-ntddndis-_ndis_receive_queue_parameters)).

3.  The miniport driver issues the status notification by calling [**NdisMIndicateStatusEx**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ndis/nf-ndis-ndismindicatestatusex). The driver must pass a pointer to the [**NDIS\_STATUS\_INDICATION**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ndis/ns-ndis-_ndis_status_indication) structure to the *StatusIndication* parameter.

Overlying drivers can use the **NDIS\_STATUS\_RECEIVE\_FILTER\_QUEUE\_PARAMETERS** status indication to determine the current VM queue parameters on the network adapter. Alternatively, these drivers can also issue object identifier (OID) query requests of [OID\_RECEIVE\_FILTER\_QUEUE\_PARAMETERS](oid-receive-filter-queue-parameters.md) to obtain these parameters at any time.
