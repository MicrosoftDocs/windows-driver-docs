# Get started with NDIS filter drivers

Filter drivers provide filtering services for miniport drivers. Network Driver Interface Specification (NDIS) driver stacks must include miniport drivers and protocol drivers and optionally include filter drivers. For more information about NDIS drivers and the driver stack, see [Driver Stack Management](driver-stack-management.md).

The following applications might require a filter driver:

- Data filtering applications for security or other purposes

- Applications that monitor and collect network data statistics
