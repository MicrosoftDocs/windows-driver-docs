# NDIS Port States





NDIS ports have operating states that include initialization states and states that are specified in the [**NDIS\_PORT\_STATE**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ntddndis/ns-ntddndis-_ndis_port_state) structure. Port states fit into the following categories:

<a href="" id="initialization-states"></a>Initialization states  
NDIS port initialization states are associated with startup initialization and Plug and Play (PnP) events. When NDIS or a miniport driver first allocates a port, the port is in the *allocated state*. After NDIS or the miniport driver activates a port, the port is in the *activated state*. Inactive ports cannot send or receive data, make status indications, receive OID requests, or initiate PnP events.

<a href="" id="link-states"></a>Link states  
NDIS port link states are similar to link states that are associated with a miniport adapter and that are specified in an [**NDIS\_LINK\_STATE**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ntddndis/ns-ntddndis-_ndis_link_state) structure. The port link states indicate the media link connection state and link speeds. The link state of a port can be different from the link state of the associated miniport adapter.

<a href="" id="authentication-states"></a>Authentication states  
NDIS port authentication states indicate if a port is controlled (requires authorization), the direction of data transmission (send, receive, or both), and the authorization state of a port (authorized, or not authorized). If a port is not controlled, the authenticated and not authenticated states are ignored.

A miniport driver can activate a port or deactivate a port with a PnP event. For more information about activating and deactivating ports, see [Activating NDIS Ports](activating-an-ndis-port.md) and [Deactivating NDIS Ports](deactivating-an-ndis-port.md).

Overlying drivers use the [OID\_GEN\_PORT\_STATE](./oid-gen-port-state.md) OID to get the current state of the port that is specified in the **PortNumber** member of the [**NDIS\_OID\_REQUEST**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/oidrequest/ns-oidrequest-ndis_oid_request) structure. NDIS handles this OID, and miniport drivers do not receive this OID query.

Miniport drivers that support NDIS ports must use the [**NDIS\_STATUS\_PORT\_STATE**](./ndis-status-port-state.md) status indication to indicate changes in the state of an NDIS port. Miniport drivers must set the port number in the **PortNumber** member of the [**NDIS\_STATUS\_INDICATION**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ndis/ns-ndis-_ndis_status_indication) structure.

NDIS and overlying drivers use the [OID\_GEN\_PORT\_AUTHENTICATION\_PARAMETERS](./oid-gen-port-authentication-parameters.md) OID to set the current authentication states of an NDIS port. Miniport drivers that support NDIS ports must support this OID.
