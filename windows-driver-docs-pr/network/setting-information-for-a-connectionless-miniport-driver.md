# Setting Information for a Connectionless Miniport Driver





To set an OID that a connectionless miniport driver maintains, a bound protocol calls [**NdisOidRequest**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ndis/nf-ndis-ndisoidrequest) and passes an [**NDIS\_OID\_REQUEST**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/oidrequest/ns-oidrequest-ndis_oid_request) structure that specifies the object (OID) that is being queried and that points to a buffer that contains the value to which the object should be set. The call to **NdisOidRequest** causes NDIS to call the miniport driver's [*MiniportOidRequest*](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ndis/nc-ndis-miniport_oid_request) function, which sets the object with the supplied value.

The call to *MiniportOidRequest* can complete synchronously or asynchronously. To complete the call asynchronously, the miniport driver calls [**NdisMOidRequestComplete**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ndis/nf-ndis-ndismoidrequestcomplete). The following diagram illustrates setting information in a connectionless miniport driver (per binding).
