# Learning About Intermediate Drivers





You can write an intermediate driver that has either a connectionless or a connection-oriented lower edge. The following list describes which sections of the WDK documentation you should read, depending on the type of intermediate driver that you are writing:

<a href="" id="intermediate-drivers-that-have-a-connectionless-lower-edge"></a>**Intermediate drivers that have a connectionless lower edge**  
If you are writing an intermediate driver whose lower edge provides an interface to connectionless miniport drivers, read:

-   [NDIS Intermediate Drivers](ndis-intermediate-drivers.md)

<a href="" id="intermediate-drivers-that-have-a-connection-oriented-lower-edge"></a>**Intermediate drivers that have a connection-oriented lower edge**  
If you are writing an intermediate driver whose lower edge provides an interface to connection-oriented miniport drivers, read:

-   [NDIS Intermediate Drivers](ndis-intermediate-drivers.md)

-   [Connection-Oriented NDIS](connection-oriented-ndis.md)
