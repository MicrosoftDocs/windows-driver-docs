# MB Multimode Multicarrier


This topic describes the support for MB multimode multicarrier that has been integrated into mobile broadband for Windows 8. Windows 8 introduces native support that allows users of carrier-unlocked mobile broadband devices that support carrier switching (most mobile broadband users outside the US) to select and connect to any supported carrier from within the Windows UI.

These features are targeted at IHVs to enable them to implement support for this scenario. They supplement the USB NCM (MBIM) spec (current version 1.0) that use the CIDs and device behavior required for supporting the MB multimode multicarrier scenario.
