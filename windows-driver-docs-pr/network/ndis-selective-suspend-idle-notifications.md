# Overview of NDIS Selective Suspend Idle Notifications


When the miniport driver has enabled and registered support for NDIS selective suspend, NDIS monitors the I/O activity of the underlying network adapter. If NDIS determines that the driver and adapter are idle, NDIS performs a selective suspend operation. This operation suspends the network adapter by transitioning the adapter to a low-power state.

NDIS starts the selective suspend operation by issuing an idle notification to the miniport driver. When the network adapter is suspended in a low-power state, the adapter can resume to a full-power state only when the idle notification is canceled. After the notification is canceled and the adapter is in a full-power state, the selective suspend operation is complete.
