# Handling a Change in the System's Power Source





The system can change from battery power to AC power or vice versa.

After initializing a miniport driver, NDIS calls a miniport driver's [*MiniportDevicePnPEventNotify*](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ndis/nc-ndis-miniport_device_pnp_event_notify) function to notify the miniport driver of the system's power source. The miniport driver can use this information to adjust the power consumption of a NIC. For example, the miniport driver for a wireless LAN (WLAN) device could reduce power consumption if the system is running on battery power or increase power consumption if the system is running on AC power.
