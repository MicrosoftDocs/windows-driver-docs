# Initializing and Unloading a SAN Proxy Driver





In addition to creating and initializing a device object for the driver object, the proxy driver's **DriverEntry** routine can register to be notified when NICs under the driver's control are either added or removed. For more information, see [Registering for SAN NIC Notifications](registering-for-san-nic-notifications.md).

If the proxy driver's SAN service provider sends I/O control requests down to the proxy driver, then **DriverEntry** must specify an *entry point* that enables device control. The provider might request, for example, to retrieve the list of IP addresses assigned to the driver's NICs. An entry point for this request is an [**IRP\_MJ\_DEVICE\_CONTROL**](../kernel/irp-mj-device-control.md) dispatch routine that returns the list of IP addresses assigned to the driver's NICs. For more information, see [Implementing IOCTLs for a SAN Service Provider](implementing-ioctls-for-a-san-service-provider.md).

The **DriverEntry** routine must specify an entry point for a routine that unloads the proxy driver. This unload routine removes the device that was created in **DriverEntry**.
