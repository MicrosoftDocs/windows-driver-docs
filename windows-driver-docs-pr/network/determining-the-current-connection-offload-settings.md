# Determining the Current Connection Offload Settings





Protocol drivers can obtain the connection offload services with an object identifier (OID) request.

To obtain the current connection offload settings of a network interface card (NIC), protocol drivers can query the [OID\_TCP\_CONNECTION\_OFFLOAD\_PARAMETERS](./oid-tcp-connection-offload-parameters.md) OID.
