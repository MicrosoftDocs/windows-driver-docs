# WMI Support for Header-Data Split





NDIS 6.1 and later supports header-data split GUIDs for WMI applications to query and set the header-data split configuration and to provide notification of changes.

The following GUIDs support header-data split:

-   GUID\_NDIS\_HD\_SPLIT\_CURRENT\_CONFIG

-   GUID\_NDIS\_HD\_SPLIT\_PARAMETERS

-   GUID\_NDIS\_STATUS\_HD\_SPLIT\_CURRENT\_CONFIG
