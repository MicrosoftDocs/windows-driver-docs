# MB UICC application and file system access

## Overview

This topic specifies an extension to the Mobile Broadband Interface Model (MBIM) interface to permit accessing UICC smart card application and file systems. This extension to MBIM exposes logical access to the UICC's [ETSI TS 102 221 technical specification](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=864594)-compliant applications and filesystems, and is supported in Windows 10, version 1903 and later.

## UICC access and security

The UICC provides a file system and supports a set of applications that can run concurrently. These include the USIM for UMTS, CSIM for CDMA, and ISIM for IMS. The SIM is a legacy portion of the UICC that can be modeled as one of these applications (for GSM).

The following diagram from Section 8.1 of the [ETSI TS 102 221 technical specification](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=864594) shows an example card application structure.

:::image type="content" source="images/mb-uicc-application-structure.png" alt-text="Diagram that shows an example UICC application structure.":::

The UICC file system can be regarded as a forest of directory trees. The legacy SIM tree is rooted at a Master File (MF) and contains up to two levels of subdirectories (Dedicated Files, or DFs) containing Elemental Files (EFs) that hold various types of information. The SIM defines DFs under the MF, one of which, DFTelecom, contains information common to multiple access types such as the common phone book. Additional applications are effectively implemented as separate trees, each rooted in its own Application Directory File (ADF). Each ADF is identified by an application identifier that can be up to 128 bits long. A file under the card root (EFDir under the MF in the diagram) contains the application names and corresponding identifiers. Within a tree (the MF or an ADF), DFs and EFs might be identified by a path of file IDs, where a file ID is a 16-bit integer.

## NDIS interface extensions

The following OIDs have been defined to support UICC application and file system access.

- [OID_WWAN_UICC_APP_LIST](oid-wwan-uicc-app-list.md)
- [OID_WWAN_UICC_FILE_STATUS](oid-wwan-uicc-file-status.md)
- [OID_WWAN_UICC_ACCESS_BINARY](oid-wwan-uicc-access-binary.md)
- [OID_WWAN_UICC_ACCESS_RECORD](oid-wwan-uicc-access-record.md)
- [OID_WWAN_PIN_EX2](oid-wwan-pin-ex2.md)

| --- | --- |
| MBIM_STATUS_BUSY | Basic MBIM status as defined for all commands. |
| MBIM_STATUS_FAILURE | Basic MBIM status as defined for all commands. |
| MBIM_STATUS_SIM_NOT_INSERTED | Unable to perform the UICC operation because the UICC is missing. |
| MBIM_STATUS_BAD_SIM | Unable to perform the UICC operation because the UICC is in an error state. |

| MBIM_STATUS_PIN_FAILURE | The operation failed due to a PIN error. |

## MBIM_CID_MS_PIN_EX

This CID is used to perform all PIN security operations as defined in Section 9 of the [ETSI TS 102 221 technical specification](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=864594). The CID is similar to MBIM_CID_MS_PIN, but extends it to support multi-app UICC cards. Only single-verification-capable UICCs are supported. Multi-verification-capable UICCs that support more than one application PIN are not supported. One application PIN (PIN1) is assigned to all ADFs/DFs and files on the UICC. However, each application can specify a local PIN (PIN2) as a level 2 user verification requirement, resulting in the need for additional validation for every access command. This scenario is what MBIM_CID_MS_PIN_EX supports.

Just like MBIM_CID_MS_PIN, with MBIM_CID_MS_PIN_EX the device only reports one PIN at a time. If multiple PINs are enabled and reporting multiple PINs is also enabled, then functions must report PIN1 first. For example, if subsidy lock reporting is enabled and the SIM's PIN1 is enabled, then the subsidy lock PIN should be reported in a subsequent query request only after PIN1 has been successfully verified. An empty PIN is permitted together with MBIMPinOperationEnter. An empty PIN is specified by setting the PinSize to zero. In this case, a SET command is similar to a QUERY and returns the state of the PIN referenced. This is fully aligned to the behavior of the VERIFY command as specified in Section 11.1.9 of the [ETSI TS 102 221 technical specification](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=864594).

### Query

The following MBIM_PIN_APP structure is used in the InformationBuffer.

#### MBIM_PIN_APP (version 1)

| Offset | Size | Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 4 | Version | UINT32 | The version number of the structure that follows. This field must be set to **1** for version 1 of this structure. |
| 4 | 4 | AppIdOffset | OFFSET | The offset, in bytes, from the beginning of this structure to the buffer containing the application ID. |
| 8 | 4 | AppIdSize | SIZE (0..16) | The size of the application ID, in bytes, as defined in Section 8.3 of the [ETSI TS 102 221 technical specification](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=864594). For 2G cards, this field must be set to zero (0). |
| 12 |   | DataBuffer | DATABUFFER | The AppId as defined in the [ETSI TS 102 221 technical specification](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=864594). |

### Set

The following MBIM_SET_PIN_EX structure is used in the InformationBuffer.

#### MBIM_SET_PIN_EX

| Offset | Size | Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 4 | PinType | MBIM_PIN_TYPE_EX | The PIN type. See the MBIM_PIN_TYPE_EX table in this topic. |
| 4 | 4 | PinOperation | MBIM_PIN_OPERATION | The PIN operation. See MBIM 1.0. |
| 8 | 4 | PinOffset | OFFSET | The offset, in bytes, calculated from the beginning of this structure to a string PIN that represents the PIN value with which to perform the action, or the PIN value required to enable or disable PIN settings. This field applies for all values of **PinOperation**. |
| 12 | 4 | PinSize | SIZE (0..32) | The size, in bytes, used for the PIN. |
| 16 | 4 | NewPinOffset | OFFSET | The offset, in bytes, calculated from the beginning of this structure to the **NewPin** string that represents the new PIN value to set when **PinOperation** is MBIMPinOperationChange or MBIMPinOperationEnter, for PinTypeMBIMPinTypePuk1 or PinTypeMBIMPinTypePuk2. |
| 20 | 4 | NewPinSize | SIZE (0..32) | The size, in bytes, used for the NewPin. |
| 24 | 4 | AppIdOffset | OFFSET | The offset, in bytes, calculated from the beginning of this structure to the buffer containing the application ID. |
| 28 | 4 | AppIdSize | SIZE (0..16) | The size of the application ID, in bytes, as defined in Section 8.3 of the [ETSI TS 102 221 technical specification](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=864594). For 2G cards, this field must be set to zero (0). |
| 32 |   | DataBuffer | DATABUFFER | The data buffer containing the Pin, NewPin, and AppId. |

### Response

The following MBIM_PIN_INFO_EX structure is used in the InformationBuffer.

| Offset | Size | Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 4 | PinType | MBIM_PIN_TYPE_EX | The PIN type. See the MBIM_PIN_TYPE_EX table in this topic. |
| 4 | 4 | PinState | MBIM_PIN_STATE | The PIN state. See MBIM 1.0. |
| 8 | 4 | RemainingAttempts | UINT32 | The number of remaining attempts for any PIN-related operations such as enter, enable, or disable. Devices that do not support this information must set this member to 0xFFFFFFFF. |

### Unsolicited Events

Not applicable.

| MBIM_STATUS_BUSY | Basic MBIM status as defined for all commands. |
| MBIM_STATUS_FAILURE | Basic MBIM status as defined for all commands. |
| MBIM_STATUS_SIM_NOT_INSERTED | Unable to perform the UICC operation because the UICC is missing. |
| MBIM_STATUS_BAD_SIM | Unable to perform the UICC operation because the UICC is in an error state. |
| MBIM_STATUS_PIN_DISABLED | The operation failed because the PIN is disabled. |
| MBIM_STATUS_PIN_REQUIRED | The operation failed because a PIN must be entered to proceed. |
| MBIM_STATUS_NO_DEVICE_SUPPORT | The operation failed because a SET on a corresponding PIN type is not supported by the device. |
