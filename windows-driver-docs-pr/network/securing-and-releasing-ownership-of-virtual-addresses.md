# Securing and Releasing Ownership of Virtual Addresses





The proxy driver must secure ownership of the virtual addresses of user-mode buffers whenever the SAN service provider for the proxy driver caches those buffers. For more information about caching buffers, see [Caching Registered Memory](caching-registered-memory.md). The proxy driver secures ownership of a user-mode buffer, so that the operating system notifies the Windows Sockets switch if the buffer is released back to the operating system by an application. To secure ownership of a buffer, the proxy driver must call the [**MmSecureVirtualMemory**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ntddk/nf-ntddk-mmsecurevirtualmemory) function. In this call, the proxy driver passes a pointer to the starting address of the buffer and the size, in bytes, of the buffer.

If the virtual-to-physical mappings for the cached buffer are scheduled to change, the switch is notified and calls the SAN service provider's [**WSPMemoryRegistrationCacheCallback**](/previous-versions/windows/hardware/network/ff566299(v=vs.85)) function to remove the buffer registration from the SAN NIC and the buffer from the SAN service provider's cache. The SAN service provider's proxy driver, in turn, must call the [**MmUnsecureVirtualMemory**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ntddk/nf-ntddk-mmunsecurevirtualmemory) function to release ownership of the buffer. In this call, the proxy driver passes the handle to the buffer that was previously returned from the **MmSecureVirtualMemory** call.

**Note**  A driver that tries to access a user-mode buffer that was secured through a call to **MmSecureVirtualMemory** can potentially bring down the operating system. Therefore, when the proxy driver accesses such a user-mode buffer, it must also use the **try/except** mechanism around the code that accesses the buffer. For more information about **try/except**, see the Visual C++ documentation.

 

A SAN service provider can send I/O control (IOCTL) requests to the proxy driver to secure and release ownership of a buffer. For more information, see [Implementing IOCTLs for a SAN Service Provider](implementing-ioctls-for-a-san-service-provider.md).
