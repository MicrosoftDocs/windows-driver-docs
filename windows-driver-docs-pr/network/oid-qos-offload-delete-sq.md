# OID_QOS_OFFLOAD_DELETE_SQ

Overlying drivers issue OID set requests of OID_QOS_OFFLOAD_DELETE_SQ to delete a Scheduler Queue (SQ) on the miniport adapter. The caller should set the **InformationBuffer** member of the [**NDIS_OID_REQUEST**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/oidrequest/ns-oidrequest-ndis_oid_request) structure to contain a pointer to an **NDIS_QOS_SQ_ID**.

## Remarks

The caller must ensure there are no resources actively referencing this SQ before deleting it.

### Return Status Codes

NDIS handles the OID set request of OID_QOS_OFFLOAD_DELETE_SQ for miniport drivers and returns one of the following status codes.

|Status Code|Description|
|--- |--- |
|NDIS_STATUS_SUCCESS|The OID request completed successfully.|
|NDIS_STATUS_NOT_SUPPORTED|The miniport driver does not support the NDIS QoS interface.|
|NDIS_STATUS_Xxx|The request failed for other reasons.|

 
## Requirements

|Requirement|Value|
|--- |--- |
|Version|Supported in NDIS 6.85 and later.|
|Header|Ntddndis.h (include Ndis.h)|
