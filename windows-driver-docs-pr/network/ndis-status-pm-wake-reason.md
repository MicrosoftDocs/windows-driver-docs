# NDIS\_STATUS\_PM\_WAKE\_REASON


The **NDIS\_STATUS\_PM\_WAKE\_REASON** status indication provides information about the wake-up event that was generated by a network adapter.

Remarks
-------

Starting with NDIS 6.30, the miniport driver issues an NDIS status indication of **NDIS\_STATUS\_PM\_WAKE\_REASON**. This status indication notifies NDIS and overlying drivers about the reason for a wake-up event generated by the network adapter.

If the miniport driver supports this type of status indication, the miniport driver must issue an **NDIS\_STATUS\_PM\_WAKE\_REASON** status indication if the network adapter generated a wake-up signal. The driver does this while it is handling the OID set request of [OID\_PNP\_SET\_POWER](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff569780) for the transition of the adapter to a full-power state.

When the miniport driver makes this status indication, it sets the **StatusBuffer** member of the [**NDIS\_STATUS\_INDICATION**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff567373) structure to a pointer to an [**NDIS\_PM\_WAKE\_REASON**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh451605) structure.

For more information about how to issue an **NDIS\_STATUS\_PM\_WAKE\_REASON** indication, see [Issuing NDIS Wake Reason Status Indications](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh463944).
