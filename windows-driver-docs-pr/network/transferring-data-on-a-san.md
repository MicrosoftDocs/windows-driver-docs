# Transferring Data on a SAN





Many system area networks (SANs) lack flow control; therefore, the Windows Sockets switch uses a lightweight session protocol to transfer data on a SAN. The following topics describe features of the switch's session protocol that enable data transfer operations for a SAN service provider:

[Using Session Protocol](using-session-protocol.md)

[Sending Urgent Data on a SAN](sending-urgent-data-on-a-san.md)

[Completing Data Transfer Requests](completing-data-transfer-requests.md)
