# Internet Key Exchange functions

The semantics of the following functions are exactly the same when called from a callout driver as when called from a user-mode application except that the return type is an NTSTATUS code instead of a Win32 error code. For a description of each of these functions, see the [Windows Filtering Platform](/windows/win32/fwp/windows-filtering-platform-start-page).

Callers of these functions must be running at IRQL = PASSIVE_LEVEL.
