# INF DDInstall.HW Section for PF Miniport Drivers


INF <em>DDInstall</em>**.HW** sections are typically used for setting up any device-specific information in the registry, whether with explicit **AddReg** directives or with **Include** and **Needs** entries.

The INF file for the miniport driver of the PCI Express (PCIe) Physical Function (PF) network adapter must have a <em>DDInstall</em>**.HW** section that contains the following INF entries:

-   An **Include** entry that specifies the pci.inf file that is included with the Windows operating system.

-   A **Needs** entry that specifies the **PciSriovSupported.HW** section to include from the pci.inf file. This section defines standard INF settings that apply to all PF miniport drivers for network adapters that support the single root I/O virtualization (SR-IOV) interface.

The following is an example of a <em>DDInstall</em>**.HW** section for a PF miniport driver:

``` syntax
[Device_Inst.NT.HW]

Include=pci.inf
Needs=PciSriovSupported.HW
```
