# TCP/IP Offload Overview

To increase its performance, the Microsoft TCP/IP transport can offload tasks or connections to a NIC that has the appropriate TCP/IP-offload capabilities.

Beginning with Windows Vista, the Windows operating system supports the following TCP/IP offload services:

-   Checksum tasks

-   Applications Internet protocol security (IPsec) offload version 1

-   IPsec offload version 2
    - \[The IPsec Task Offload feature is deprecated and should not be used.\]

-   Large send offload version 1

-   Large send offload version 2

-   Connection offload

Starting in Windows 10, version 2004, Windows also supports UDP Segmentation Offload (USO).

The TCP/IP transport that is provided beginning with Windows Vista supports TCP/IP offload services for both IPv4 and IPv6 packets.

NDIS 6.0 and later miniport drivers support TCP/IP offload services in a multiple-protocol driver environment. Multiple NDIS 6.0 and later protocol drivers that are bound to a TCP/IP offload-capable miniport adapter can configure TCP/IP offload services.
