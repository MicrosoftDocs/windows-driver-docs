# Hyper-V Extensible Switch Extensions


This section describes the type of NDIS filter drivers that are supported in the extensible switch interface. These filter drivers are known as *extensible switch extensions*.

This section includes the following topics:

[Capturing Extensions](capturing-extensions.md)

[Filtering Extensions](filtering-extensions.md)

[Forwarding Extensions](forwarding-extensions.md)

**Note**  If multiple extensions of the same type are bound to an extensible switch instance, the order in which they are layered within the extensible switch driver stack can be modified. For more information, see [Reordering Hyper-V Extensible Switch Extensions](reordering-hyper-v-extensibility-switch-extensions.md).
