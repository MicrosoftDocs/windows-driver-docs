# VMQ Driver Configuration


## <a href="" id="ddk-virtual-machine-queue-overview-nr"></a>


This section describes the features that NDIS provides to determine the virtual machine queue (VMQ) capabilities of network adapters.

A miniport driver reports its VMQ capabilities to NDIS and overlying drivers during network adapter initialization.

Standardized INF file entries can enable or disable VMQ features when a driver is installed.

This section includes the following topics:

[Determining the VMQ Capabilities of a Network Adapter](determining-the-vmq-capabilities-of-a-network-adapter.md)

[Standardized INF Keywords for VMQ](standardized-inf-keywords-for-vmq.md)
