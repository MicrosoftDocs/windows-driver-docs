# VMQ Driver Configuration





This section describes the features that NDIS provides to determine the virtual machine queue (VMQ) capabilities of network adapters.

A miniport driver reports its VMQ capabilities to NDIS and overlying drivers during network adapter initialization.

Standardized INF file entries can enable or disable VMQ features when a driver is installed.

This section includes the following topics:

[Standardized INF Keywords for VMQ](standardized-inf-keywords-for-vmq.md)
