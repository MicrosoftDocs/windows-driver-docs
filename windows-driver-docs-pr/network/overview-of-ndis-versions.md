# Overview of NDIS versions

If you're writing an NDIS driver for more than one version of Microsoft Windows, be sure the features that you're using are supported on each Windows version. New features have been added to NDIS with each release. Other features became obsolete and were removed from later NDIS versions.

This set of design guide documentation is targeted at Windows Vista and later operating systems and NDIS 6.0 and later drivers. Documentation for earlier Windows and NDIS versions is contained in prior releases of the documentation. For the Windows XP and NDIS 5.1 documentation, see [Windows 2000 and Windows XP Networking Design Guide](/previous-versions/windows/hardware/network/ff565849(v=vs.85)).

> [!NOTE]
> A driver can query the NDIS version by calling the [**NdisReadConfiguration**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ndis/nf-ndis-ndisreadconfiguration) function with the *Keyword* parameter set to **NdisVersion**. 

The following table describes Windows operating system, Microsoft Windows Driver Kit (WDK), and Driver Development Kit (DDK) version support for NDIS versions. This table also describes support for major NDIS features across NDIS versions.
