# MB base stations information query support

## Overview

The base stations information query interface is used to provide location based services with cellular base station information, such as *Base Station ID*, *Time Advance*, and other parameters that can be used to compute the geographical position of the mobile subscriber. The information gathered pertains to the cellular base station currently serving the subscriber, as well as neighboring cellular base stations. 

This topic defines the base stations information query interface for Windows, as the MBIM 1.0 specification does not provide this information through any existing CIDs. This interface is available in Windows 10, version 1709 and later. 

Serving and neighbor cell parameters are retrieved via Query/Response operations. A notification is also defined in this topic to indicate that the location of the device within the cellular network has changed.

## <a name="mbim_cid_base_stations_info"></a>MBIM_CID_BASE_STATIONS_INFO

This command retrieves information about the serving and neighbor cells known to the modem.

Service: **MBB_UUID_BASIC_CONNECT_EXTENSIONS**

Service UUID: **3d01dcc5-fef5-4d05-0d3a-bef7058e9aaf**

### Parameters

| Type | Set | Query | Notification |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Command | Not applicable | Not applicable | Not applicable |
| Response | Not appliable | MBIM_LOCATION_INFO | MBIM_LOCATION_INFO |

### Set

Not applicable.

### Response

#### <a name="mbim_location_info"></a>MBIM_LOCATION_INFO

| Offset | Size | Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 4 | LocationAreaCode | UINT32 | The GSM/UMTS area code of the current location. Return 0xFFFFFFFF when the current system type is not applicable. |
| 4 | 4 | TrackingAreaCode | UINT32 | The LTE tracking area code of the current location. Return 0xFFFFFFFF when the current system type is not applicable. |
| 8 | 4 | CellID | UINT32 | The ID of the cellular tower. Return 0xFFFFFFFF when *CellID* is not available. |

### Unsolicited Events

The event InformationBuffer contains an MBIM_LOCATION_INFO structure.

This event is sent if the value of *Location Area Code*/*Tracking Area Code* changes to a valid value. This event is not sent when *CellID* changes or when *Location Area Code*/*Tracking Area Code* becomes invalid.
