# Overview of NDIS Network Interfaces





NDIS network interfaces provide a consistent representation for all of the various network interfaces that Microsoft Windows supports. Without the NDIS network interface services, all network interfaces are not visible to the computer administrator, and the interfaces that are visible do not necessarily support the management information base (MIB). Also, NDIS network interface services enable the layering relationships between interfaces to be visible to the administrator.

This section includes:

[NDIS Network Interface Services](ndis-network-interface-services.md)

[NDIS Network Interface Architecture](ndis-network-interface-architecture.md)

[NDIS Interface Provider Operations](ndis-interface-provider-operations.md)

[NDIS Interface Types](ndis-interface-types.md)

> [!NOTE]
> The NDIS 6.0 Network Interfaces section refers to many Request for Comments (RFCs) from the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). To view an IETF RFC, visit the [IETF Request for Comments](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=45661) Web site, and search for the RFC in the **RFC number** box under **IETF repository retrieval**.
