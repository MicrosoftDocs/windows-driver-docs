# OID\_PNP\_WAKE\_UP\_ERROR





The optional OID\_PNP\_WAKE\_UP\_ERROR OID indicates the number of false wake-ups that are signaled by the miniport driver's network adapter. A false wake-up occurs when the network adapter wakes up the system when it shouldn't have. For example, the network adapter could erroneously wake up the system due to an inexact pattern match.

The data type for this OID is a ULONG value.

An intermediate driver in which the upper edge receives this OID request must always propagate the request to the underlying miniport driver by calling Ndis(Co)Request.
