# OID\_RECEIVE\_FILTER\_ENUM\_QUEUES


Overlying drivers and user-mode applications issue object identifier (OID) query requests of OID\_RECEIVE\_FILTER\_ENUM\_QUEUES to obtain a list of all the receive queues that are allocated on a network adapter.

After a successful return from the OID query request, the **InformationBuffer** member of the [**NDIS\_OID\_REQUEST**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/oidrequest/ns-oidrequest-ndis_oid_request) structure contains a pointer to an [**NDIS\_RECEIVE\_QUEUE\_INFO\_ARRAY**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ntddndis/ns-ntddndis-_ndis_receive_queue_info_array) structure that is followed by an [**NDIS\_RECEIVE\_QUEUE\_INFO**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ntddndis/ns-ntddndis-_ndis_receive_queue_info) structure for each filter.

## Remarks

NDIS obtained the information from an internal cache of the data that it received from the [OID\_RECEIVE\_FILTER\_ALLOCATE\_QUEUE](oid-receive-filter-allocate-queue.md) and [OID\_RECEIVE\_FILTER\_QUEUE\_PARAMETERS](oid-receive-filter-queue-parameters.md) OID requests.

Overlying drivers and user-mode applications issue OID query requests of OID\_RECEIVE\_FILTER\_ENUM\_QUEUES to enumerate the receive queues on a network adapter.

If a protocol driver issues the request, the request type inside the [**NDIS\_OID\_REQUEST**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/oidrequest/ns-oidrequest-ndis_oid_request) structure is set to **NdisRequestQueryInformation** and this OID returns an array of all the receive queues that the protocol driver allocated on the network adapter. If a user-mode application issued the request, the request type inside the **NDIS\_OID\_REQUEST** structure is set to **NdisRequestQueryStatistics**, and this OID returns an array of information for all the receive queues on the network adapter.

### Return Status Codes

NDIS handles the OID query request of OID\_RECEIVE\_FILTER\_ENUM\_QUEUES for miniport drivers, and returns one of the following status codes.
