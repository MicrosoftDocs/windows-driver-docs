# Connectionless Environment for Network Drivers


## <a href="" id="ddk-connectionless-environment-for-network-drivers-ng"></a>


The connectionless environment is the standard network driver environment for connectionless media, such as Ethernet. For a description of the drivers in this environment, see [NDIS Drivers](ndis-drivers.md) and [NDIS Miniport Drivers](ndis-miniport-drivers2.md).

The following figure shows the NDIS environment for connectionless network drivers.
