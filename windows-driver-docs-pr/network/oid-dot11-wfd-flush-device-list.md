# OID\_DOT11\_WFD\_FLUSH\_DEVICE\_LIST


**Important**  The [Native 802.11 Wireless LAN](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff560690) interface is deprecated in Windows 10 and later. Please use the WLAN Device Driver Interface (WDI) instead. For more information about WDI, see [WLAN Universal Windows driver model](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/dn897672).

 

When set, the OID\_DOT11\_WFD\_FLUSH\_DEVICE\_LIST object identifier (OID) requests that the miniport driver clear the device list cached in the Wi-Fi Direct (WFD) device. The miniport must flush the list of WFD devices and Group Owners (GOs) when it receives this OID.

The miniport may also flush the list of infrastructure access points and discovered adhoc networks when it receives this OID.

No data is sent with this OID.
