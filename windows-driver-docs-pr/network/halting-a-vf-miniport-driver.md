# Halting a VF Miniport Driver


The VF miniport driver follows the same steps as any NDIS miniport driver when its [*MiniportHaltEx*](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ndis/nc-ndis-miniport_halt) function is called. For more information about these steps, see [Halting a Miniport Adapter](halting-a-miniport-adapter.md).
