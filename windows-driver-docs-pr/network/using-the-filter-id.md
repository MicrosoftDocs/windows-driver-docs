# Using the Filter ID


Overlying drivers download receive filters to the miniport driver by issuing OID method requests of [OID\_RECEIVE\_FILTER\_SET\_FILTER](./oid-receive-filter-set-filter.md). Each receive filter that is downloaded to the miniport driver has a unique filter identifier (ID) that is generated by NDIS. The overlying driver must use this filter ID in later OID requests in order to do the following:

-   Query the receive filter parameters. For more information about how to query the parameters of a receive filter, see [Querying Packet Coalescing Receive Filters](querying-packet-coalescing-receive-filters.md).

-   Modify the receive filter parameters. For more information about how to modify the parameters of a receive filter, see [Modifying Packet Coalescing Receive Filters](modifying-packet-coalescing-receive-filters.md).

-   Free, or *clear*, a receive filter. For more information about how to clear receive filters, see [Clearing Packet Coalescing Receive Filters](clearing-packet-coalescing-receive-filters.md).

The miniport driver must retain the filter IDs for the allocated receive filters. When it receives an OID request to modify, query, or free a receive filter, the miniport driver must verify that the specified filter ID in the OID request matches an allocated receive filter from a previous OID method request of [OID\_RECEIVE\_FILTER\_SET\_FILTER](./oid-receive-filter-set-filter.md). If the filter ID does not match any of the allocated receive filters, the miniport driver must complete the OID request with a failed status.
