# Initialization Sequence for PF Miniport Drivers


This section describes the requirements and guidelines for the initialization sequence of a miniport driver for the PCI Express (PCIe) Physical Function (PF). The PF is a component of a network adapter that supports single root I/O virtualization (SR-IOV).

This section includes the following topics:

[DriverEntry Guidelines for PF Miniport Drivers](driverentry-guidelines-for-pf-miniport-drivers.md)

[*MiniportAddDevice* Guidelines for PF Miniport Drivers](miniportadddevice-guidelines-for-pf-miniport-drivers.md)

[*MiniportInitializeEx* Guidelines for PF Miniport Drivers](miniportinitializeex-guidelines-for-pf-miniport-drivers.md)

**Note**  For information on initializing miniport drivers for a PCIe Virtual Function (VF) on the SR-IOV network adapter, see [Initializing a VF Miniport Driver](initializing-a-vf-miniport-driver.md).
