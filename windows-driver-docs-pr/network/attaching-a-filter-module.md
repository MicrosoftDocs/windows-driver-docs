# Attaching a Filter Module





To initiate the process of inserting a filter module into a driver stack, NDIS calls a filter driver's [*FilterAttach*](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ndis/nc-ndis-filter_attach) function. At the start of execution in the *FilterAttach* function, the filter module enters the *Attaching* state. For more information about attaching a filter module to a driver stack, see [Starting a Driver Stack](starting-a-driver-stack.md).

A filter driver uses the handle, that NDIS passes at the *NdisFilterHandle* parameter of [*FilterAttach*](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ndis/nc-ndis-filter_attach) in all future **NdisXxx** function calls that refer to this filter module. Such functions include status indications, send requests, receive indications, and OID requests.

While a filter module is in the *Attaching* state, the driver:

-   Creates a context area for the filter module and allocates buffer pools and other filter module-specific resources. For more information about buffer pools, see [Filter Driver Buffer Management](filter-driver-buffer-management.md).

-   Calls the [**NdisFSetAttributes**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ndis/nf-ndis-ndisfsetattributes) function by using the *NdisFilterHandle* value that NDIS passed to [*FilterAttach*](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ndis/nc-ndis-filter_attach). The *FilterModuleContext* parameter of **NdisFSetAttributes** specifies the filter driver's context area for this filter module. NDIS passes this context area to the filter driver's *FilterXxx* functions.

-   Optionally, reads configuration parameters for this filter module from the registry. For more information, see [Accessing Configuration Information for a Filter Driver](accessing-configuration-information-for-a-filter-driver.md).

-   If the preceding operations completed successfully, the filter module is in the *Paused* state.

-   If the preceding operations failed, the filter driver must release any resources that it allocated in the [*FilterAttach*](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ndis/nc-ndis-filter_attach) function and return the filter module to the *Detached* state.

-   Returns NDIS\_STATUS\_SUCCESS or an appropriate failure code. If the driver returns a failure code, NDIS terminates the driver stack.

**Note**  The registry can contain a flag, which specifies that a filter module is optional. If an optional filter module does not attach, NDIS does not terminate the rest of the driver stack.

 

A filter driver cannot make send requests, indicate received data, make OID requests, or make status indications from the *Attaching* state. Send and receive operations are supported in the *Running* and *Pausing* states. OID requests and status indications are supported in the *Paused*, *Restarting*, *Running*, and *Pausing* states.

NDIS calls the [*FilterDetach*](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ndis/nc-ndis-filter_detach) function to detach a filter module that NDIS attached with [*FilterAttach*](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ndis/nc-ndis-filter_attach). For more information, see [Detaching a Filter Module](detaching-a-filter-module.md).
