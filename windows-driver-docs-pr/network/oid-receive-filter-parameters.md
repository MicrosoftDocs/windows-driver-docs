# OID\_RECEIVE\_FILTER\_PARAMETERS


An overlying driver issues an OID method request of OID\_RECEIVE\_FILTER\_PARAMETERS to obtain the current configuration parameters of a filter on a network adapter.

The **InformationBuffer** member of the [**NDIS\_OID\_REQUEST**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/oidrequest/ns-oidrequest-ndis_oid_request) structure contains a pointer to an [**NDIS\_RECEIVE\_FILTER\_PARAMETERS**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ntddndis/ns-ntddndis-_ndis_receive_filter_parameters) structure. NDIS uses the **FilterId** member in the input structure to identify the filter.

After a successful return from the OID method request, the **InformationBuffer** member of the [**NDIS\_OID\_REQUEST**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/oidrequest/ns-oidrequest-ndis_oid_request) structure contains a pointer to a buffer. This buffer is formatted to contain the following:

-   An [**NDIS\_RECEIVE\_FILTER\_PARAMETERS**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ntddndis/ns-ntddndis-_ndis_receive_filter_parameters) structure that specifies the parameters for an NDIS receive filter.

-   An array of [**NDIS\_RECEIVE\_FILTER\_FIELD\_PARAMETERS**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ntddndis/ns-ntddndis-_ndis_receive_filter_field_parameters) structures that specifies the filter test criterion for a field in a network packet header.

## Remarks

NDIS receive filters are used in the following NDIS interfaces:

-   [NDIS Packet Coalescing](./ndis-packet-coalescing.md). For more information about how to use receive filters in this interface, see [Managing Packet Coalescing Receive Filters](./guidelines-for-managing-packet-coalescing-receive-filters.md).

-   [Single Root I/O Virtualization (SR-IOV)](./single-root-i-o-virtualization--sr-iov-.md). For more information about how to use receive filters in this interface, see [Setting a Receive Filter on a Virtual Port](./setting-a-receive-filter-on-a-virtual-port.md).

-   [Virtual Machine Queue (VMQ)](./virtual-machine-queue--vmq--in-ndis-6-20.md). For more information about how to use receive filters in this interface, see [Setting and Clearing VMQ Filters](./setting-and-clearing-vmq-filters.md).

Overlying drivers issue OID method requests of OID\_RECEIVE\_FILTER\_PARAMETERS to obtain the configuration parameters for a receive filter that was set on a network adapter. This includes a receive filter that was set on a VMQ receive queue or SR-IOV virtual port (VPort), as well as a packet coalescing filter that was downloaded to the miniport driver.

The overlying driver obtained the filter identifier from an earlier OID method request of [OID\_RECEIVE\_FILTER\_SET\_FILTER](oid-receive-filter-set-filter.md) or from OID requests of [OID\_RECEIVE\_FILTER\_ENUM\_FILTERS](oid-receive-filter-enum-filters.md).

### Return status codes

NDIS handles the OID request of OID\_RECEIVE\_FILTER\_PARAMETERS for miniport drivers, and returns one of the following status codes:

<a href="" id="ndis-status-success"></a>NDIS\_STATUS\_SUCCESS  
The request completed successfully. The **InformationBuffer** points to an [**NDIS\_RECEIVE\_FILTER\_PARAMETERS**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ntddndis/ns-ntddndis-_ndis_receive_filter_parameters) structure.

<a href="" id="ndis-status-pending"></a>NDIS\_STATUS\_PENDING  
The request is pending completion. NDIS passes the final status code and results to the OID request completion handler of the caller after the request is complete.

<a href="" id="ndis-status-invalid-parameter"></a>NDIS\_STATUS\_INVALID\_PARAMETER  
The overlying driver or application provided an invalid filter identifier. A filter identifier is not valid if it is zero or if it specifies an undefined filter.

<a href="" id="ndis-status-invalid-length"></a>NDIS\_STATUS\_INVALID\_LENGTH  
The information buffer was too short. NDIS sets the **DATA.QUERY\_INFORMATION.BytesNeeded** member in the [**NDIS\_OID\_REQUEST**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/oidrequest/ns-oidrequest-ndis_oid_request) structure to the minimum buffer size that is required.

<a href="" id="ndis-status-failure"></a>NDIS\_STATUS\_FAILURE  
The request failed for other reasons.
