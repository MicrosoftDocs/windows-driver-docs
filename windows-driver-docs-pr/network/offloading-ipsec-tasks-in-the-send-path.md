# Offloading IPsec Tasks in the Send Path

\[The IPsec Task Offload feature is deprecated and should not be used.\]




Before the TCP/IP transport passes to the miniport driver a [**NET\_BUFFER\_LIST**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/nbl/ns-nbl-net_buffer_list) structure for a packet on which a NIC will perform Internet protocol security (IPsec) tasks, it updates the IPsec information that is associated with the NET\_BUFFER\_LIST structure. The TCP/IP transport specifies this information in an [**NDIS\_IPSEC\_OFFLOAD\_V1\_NET\_BUFFER\_LIST\_INFO**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ndis/ns-ndis-_ndis_ipsec_offload_v1_net_buffer_list_info) structure, which is part of the NET\_BUFFER\_LIST information (out-of-band data) that is associated with the NET\_BUFFER\_LIST structure.

The TCP/IP transport supplies *OffloadHandle*, which specifies the handle to the outbound SA for the transport (end-to-end connection) portion of the send packet. If the packet will be transmitted through a tunnel, the TCP/IP transport also supplies *NextOffloadHandle*, which specifies the handle to the outbound SA for the tunnel portion of the send packet.

After a miniport driver receives the [**NET\_BUFFER\_LIST**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/nbl/ns-nbl-net_buffer_list) structure in its [*MiniportSendNetBufferLists*](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ndis/nc-ndis-miniport_send_net_buffer_lists) or [**MiniportCoSendNetBufferLists**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ndis/nc-ndis-miniport_co_send_net_buffer_lists) function, it can call the [**NET\_BUFFER\_LIST\_INFO**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/nblaccessors/nf-nblaccessors-net_buffer_list_info) macro with an *\_Id* of **IPsecOffloadV1NetBufferListInfo** to obtain the NDIS\_IPSEC\_OFFLOAD\_V1\_NET\_BUFFER\_LIST\_INFO structure that is associated with the NET\_BUFFER\_LIST structure.

When the NIC performs IPsec processing on a send packet, it calculates the AH or ESP encryption checksums (or both) for the packet and, if the packet contains an ESP payload, encrypts the packet. The TCP/IP transport has already framed the packet, padded it (if necessary), and assigned it a sequence number and SPI.
