# Canceling a Send Request in a Miniport Driver





The following figure illustrates a miniport driver cancel send operation.

Protocol, filter, and intermediate drivers can call [**NdisCancelSendNetBufferLists**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ndis/nf-ndis-ndiscancelsendnetbufferlists) to cancel outstanding send requests. These overlying drivers must mark the send data with a cancellation ID before making a send request.

NDIS calls a miniport driver's [*MiniportCancelSend*](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ndis/nc-ndis-miniport_cancel_send) function to cancel the transmission of all [**NET\_BUFFER\_LIST**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/nbl/ns-nbl-net_buffer_list) structures that are marked with a specified cancellation identifier.

A miniport driver's *MiniportCancelSend* function performs the following operations:

1.  Traverses its list of outstanding send requests for the specified adapter and calls [**NDIS\_GET\_NET\_BUFFER\_LIST\_CANCEL\_ID**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ndis/nf-ndis-ndis_get_net_buffer_list_cancel_id) to obtain the cancellation identifier for each NET\_BUFFER\_LIST structure. The miniport driver compares the cancellation ID that NDIS\_GET\_NET\_BUFFER\_LIST\_CANCEL\_ID returns with the cancellation ID that NDIS passed to *MiniportCancelSend*.

2.  Removes from all NET\_BUFFER\_LIST structures whose cancellation identifiers match the specified cancellation identifier from its list of outstanding send requests.

3.  Calls the [**NdisMSendNetBufferListsComplete**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ndis/nf-ndis-ndismsendnetbufferlistscomplete) function for all canceled NET\_BUFFER\_LIST structures to return the structures.The miniport driver sets the status field of the NET\_BUFFER\_LIST structures to NDIS\_STATUS\_SEND\_ABORTED.
