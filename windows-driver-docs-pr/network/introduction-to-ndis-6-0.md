# Introduction to NDIS 6.0





NDIS 6.0 is the next major version of the Network Driver Interface Specification (NDIS) library. NDIS specifies a standard interface between kernel-mode network drivers and the operating system. NDIS also specifies a standard interface between layered network drivers, thereby abstracting lower-level drivers that manage hardware from upper-level drivers, such as network transports. NDIS 6.0 is included in the Windows Vista operating system.

This section provides an introduction to NDIS 6.0 and describes the major design objectives, how these objectives have been met, and the advantages of NDIS 6.0.

This section includes the following topics:

[NDIS 6.0 Design Objectives](ndis-6-0-design-objectives.md)

[Enhanced Performance and Scalability](enhanced-performance-and-scalability.md)

[Simplified Driver Model](simplified-driver-model.md)

For a description of the differences between NDIS 6.0 and earlier versions, and for detailed information about porting drivers to NDIS 6.0, see [Porting NDIS 5.x Drivers to NDIS 6.0](porting-ndis-5-x-drivers-to-ndis-6-0.md).
