# NDIS_STATUS_WDI_INDICATION_DEVICE_SERVICE_EVENT

[!INCLUDE [WDI topic note](../includes/wdi-version-warning.md)]

The NDIS_STATUS_WDI_INDICATION_DEVICE_SERVICE_EVENT status indication is used by an IHV miniport driver to pass on unsolicited information about a device to a user mode client.

Device service indications must be sent by the miniport driver only when in the *D0* power state, and it must not cause the device to wake from *Dx*. WDI will drop this indication without forwarding it up the stack if it receives it when in *Dx*.

This indication is currently handled only on the default port (station).

The miniport driver should send a separate notification for every device service GUID and opcode pair whenever necessary.

## Payload data
