# Connection Offload Overview





To increase its performance, the Microsoft TCP/IP transport can offload connections to a NIC that has the appropriate TCP/IP-connection offload capabilities.

The NDIS connection offload interface provides hooks to enable configuration of connection offload services such as TCP chimney offload. For more information about connection offload services in NDIS, see [Offloading TCP/IP Connections](offloading-tcp-ip-connections.md).

TCP chimney offload services are supported in NDIS 6.0 and later.
