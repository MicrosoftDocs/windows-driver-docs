# Indicating Received Data from a CoNDIS WAN Miniport Driver





The following operations occur when a CoNDIS WAN miniport driver receives a network data packet:

1.  The driver removes driver-specific encapsulation from the network data packet, if necessary before calling [**NdisMCoIndicateReceiveNetBufferLists**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ndis/nf-ndis-ndismcoindicatereceivenetbufferlists) to indicate the received data in a NET\_BUFFER\_LIST structure. For example, the driver can remove PPPoE encapsulation. However, the miniport driver should leave encapsulated data, such as PPP header and payload, intact.

2.  The driver calls the **NdisMCoIndicateReceiveNetBufferLists** function to indicate to NDISWAN that a packet has arrived.

3.  NDISWAN processes the packet and calls [**NdisMIndicateReceiveNetBufferLists**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ndis/nf-ndis-ndismindicatereceivenetbufferlists) to indicate the arrival of the packet.

4.  To forward the packet, NDIS calls the [**ProtocolReceiveNetBufferLists**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ndis/nc-ndis-protocol_receive_net_buffer_lists) function of bound overlying protocol drivers.
