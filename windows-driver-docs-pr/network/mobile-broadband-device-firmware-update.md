# Mobile Broadband Device Firmware Update


This topic provides guidance to Mobile Broadband (MB) module manufacturers intending to support firmware upgrade devices via Windows Update (WU). The devices must be compliant with the [USB NCM Mobile Broadband Interface Model (MBIM) V1.0 specification](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=320791) released by the USB-IF Device Working Group.

The information in this topic applies to:

-   Windows 8/Windows 10/Windows 11

## Device Requirements


To support firmware updates on Mobile Broadband using Windows Update, module or device manufacturers need to comply with the following requirements:

-   UMDF (User Mode Driver Framework) based driver developed by the module or device manufacturer, packaged along with the INF file and firmware payload. Sample INF file and details are provided in the later part of this document
-   Device firmware to implement the following functionalities:
    -   Firmware ID Device Service (FID). For more information, see **FID Device Service**.
    -   Firmware to support a firmware update device service. This is a device manufacturer specific device service that provides the ability for an UMDF driver to call into and execute/download the firmware payload and start the firmware update process.

**Operational Overview**

The following diagram shows the high level design and interaction between the three components involved: MBIM device, Windows 8 Operating System and IHV supplied firmware upgrade driver.

:::image type="content" source="images/mbdevicefirmwareupdate.png" alt-text="Diagram showing the interaction between MBIM device, Windows 8 OS, and IHV supplied firmware upgrade driver.":::

-   When the WWAN Service detects the arrival of new MB device, it will check if device support Firmware ID (FID) Device Service. If it is present, it will retrieve the FID, which is defined to be GUID. The Firmware Device Service specification that the IHV needs to the support on the device is described **below**.
-   WWAN Service (Windows OS) will generate “soft device-node” using the FID obtained above as the device hardware Id. This referred to as “Soft Dev Node” in the diagram above. The creation of the dev-node will kick start PnP subsystem (Windows OS) to find the best matched driver. In Windows 8, PnP system will first attempt to install a driver from the local store, if one is available, and in parallel OS will attempt to fetch a better matched driver from WU. The inbox NULL driver will used be used as default if better match driver is not available to eliminate “Driver Not Found” issue.
-   The IHV WU package, based on the FID match, is pulled down to the machine and installed. It is expected that the FID represents a unique firmware SKU (uniqueness here is defined by combination device VID/PID/REV and MNO). WU package would contain an IHV authored UMDF driver as well as a firmware payload.
-   Once the IHV UMDF is loaded on the soft dev-node it is responsible for controlling the firmware update flow. It should be noted that the life time of the soft dev-node is tied to physical presence of the MBIM device. The UMDF driver shall perform the following steps to performing firmware updates
    -   It is acceptable for the device to reboot multiple times during the firmware update process, but would cause the UMDF driver to get unloaded/reloaded
    -   The entire firmware upgrade process, including reboots, should take place no more than 60 seconds.
    -   After the firmware update is completed and device has reverted to MBIM mode, Windows should be notified. This is done by clearing the previously set DEVPKEY\_Device\_PostInstallInProgress property. The [**IWDFUnifiedPropertyStore**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wudfddi/nn-wudfddi-iwdfunifiedpropertystore) interface describes how to set a property on dev-node. A previously set property can be cleared using DEVPROP\_TYPE\_EMPTY.
    -   During OnPrepareHardware UMDF callback, the UMDF driver shall check if the firmware on the device needs to be updated. This is done by comparing the version of the firmware on the device against the one that came in via Windows Update. Additional guidance is provided later in the document regarding placement location of firmware binary. If firmware update is required, the UMDF driver should:
        -   [Schedule a work-item](../wdf/using-workitems.md). The actual firmware upgrade happens in the context of the work-item.
        -   Once the work-item is successfully scheduled, notify Windows about the start of firmware update. It is done by setting the DEVPKEY\_Device\_PostInstallInProgress property on the soft dev-node in the context of OnPrepareHardware UMDF callback.
        -   It is important not to block the OnPrepareHardware callback while the firmware update is in progress. It is expected that OnPrepareHardware callback is completed within a second or two at the most.

**Sample INF file for the WU Package**

This section provides a sample INF that is part of the WU package. The key points to note in INF file are:

-   The firmware binaries are independent of the UMDF driver.
-   The firmware binaries are located in the driverstore directory, a path determined by the operating system and referenced in the INF using DIRID 13. The binaries cannot be not be executable files containing PE/COFF headers.
-   `%13%\<UniqueBinaryName>.bin`
-   The INF file stores this location in the registry and the UMDF driver reads the registry value to discover the binary location.
-   The sample INF template below has highlighted items that need to be filled by the IHV.

**Firmware Identification Device Service (FID Device Service)**

The MBIM compliant device will implement and report the following device service when queried by CID\_MBIM\_DEVICE\_SERVICES. The existing well-known services are defined in the NCM MBIM spec in section 10.1. Microsoft Corporation extends this to define the following service.

Service Name = **Microsoft Firmware ID**

UUID = **UUID\_MSFWID UUID**

Value = **e9f7dea2-feaf-4009-93ce-90a3694103b6**

Specifically, the following CID is defined for UUID\_MSFWID device service:

CID = **CID\_MBIM\_MSFWID\_FIRMWAREID**

Command Code = **1**

Query = **Yes**

Set = **No**

Event = **No**

Set InformationBuffer payload = **N/A**

Query InformationBuffer payload = **N/A**

Completion InformationBuffer payload = **UUID**

**CID\_MBIM\_MSFWID\_FIRMWAREID**

The command returns the MNO or IHV assigned Firmware ID for the device. The UUID is encoded based on the guidelines in the MBIM specification.

Query = **InformationBuffer on MBIM\_COMMAND\_MSG not used. UUID returned in InformationBuffer MBIM\_COMMAND\_DONE.**

Set = **Unsupported**

Unsolicited Event = **Unsupported**

**Code snippets for behavior of UMDF driver**

As indicated earlier, the UMDF driver should indicate to the Windows when it starts and completes firmware upgrade. This section provides code snippets that show how the driver should notify Windows of these events.

```cpp
/**
 * This is the IPnpCallbackHardware*:OnPrepareHardware handler 
 * in the UMDF driver. This is called every time the firmware 
 * update is device is started. Since this handler should be 
 * blocked from returning actual the firmware update process 
 * should be done in a workitem 
 */

    //
    // The snippets below demonstrates the steps for firmware 
    // update against a MB device that loads the updated firmware 
    // on device boot. So the firmware update driver needs to
    // send the new firmware down to the device and then tell 
    // the device to initiate a stop/start. Once the device has
    // reappeared, it would have automatically loaded the 
    // new firmware
    // 


    //
    // First, determine if firmware update is in progress. This 
    // can be based on some registry key that is saved when

        // multiple stop/starts to do the firmware update. In that case
        // it will be marked as done at the end of the process
        //
