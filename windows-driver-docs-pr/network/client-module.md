# Client Module


A *client module* is a [network module](network-module.md) that supports and implements the client side of a [Network Programming Interface (NPI)](network-programming-interface.md). A client module registers itself with the Network Module Registrar as a *Client* of the NPI that it supports. A client module can register itself as a client of more than one NPI. A network module can be both a client module and a [provider module](provider-module.md).
