# OID\_WDI\_SET\_ADVERTISEMENT\_INFORMATION

[!INCLUDE [WDI topic note](../includes/wdi-version-warning.md)]


OID\_WDI\_SET\_ADVERTISEMENT\_INFORMATION configures the Information Elements (IEs) and other advertisement settings to be included in the probe request, probe response, and beacons sent by the specified port. This request is only applicable to Wi-Fi Direct ports.

| Scope | Set serialized with task | Normal execution time (seconds) |
|-------|--------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Port  | Yes                      | 1                               |

 

When this command is received by the device, it shall update any relevant Wi-Fi Direct IEs, and append any necessary additional IEs in future outgoing messages sent by this port.

## Set property parameters


WDI can provide a pre-configured set of prefix hashes for the advertised services. If a peer sends a hash, the driver first tries to match with a service name hash as defined in [**WDI\_TLV\_P2P\_ADVERTISED\_PREFIX\_ENTRY**](./wdi-tlv-p2p-advertised-prefix-entry.md). If a match is found from the prefix hashes, the driver searches for the service(s) in [**WDI\_TLV\_P2P\_ADVERTISED\_SERVICE\_ENTRY**](./wdi-tlv-p2p-advertised-service-entry.md) that have the prefix and responds with those. If a match is not found, the driver tries to match the requested service name hash in [**WDI\_TLV\_P2P\_ADVERTISED\_SERVICE\_ENTRY**](./wdi-tlv-p2p-advertised-service-entry.md).
