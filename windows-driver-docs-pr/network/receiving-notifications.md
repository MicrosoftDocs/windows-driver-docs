# Receiving Notifications




 

The operating system forwards IHV-specific indications from the Native 802.11 miniport driver by calling the [*Dot11ExtIhvReceiveIndication*](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wlanihv/nc-wlanihv-dot11extihv_receive_indication) function. For more information about how the driver makes this type of indication, see [IHV-Specific Indications](/previous-versions/windows/hardware/wireless/ihv-specific-indications).

When the [*Dot11ExtIhvReceiveIndication*](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wlanihv/nc-wlanihv-dot11extihv_receive_indication) function is called, the *pvBuffer* parameter is passed a pointer to a buffer that contains data in a format defined by the IHV.
