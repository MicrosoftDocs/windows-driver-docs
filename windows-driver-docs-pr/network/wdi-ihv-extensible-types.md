# WDI IHV extensible types


The WDI model allows the IHV to support custom PHY type, authentication algorithms, and cipher algorithms. The IHV extension PHY type is used mainly for reporting purposes and does not change the operating system behavior. The IHV extension authentication and cipher algorithms are used with the IHV extensibility module and IHV profiles. When these are used for a connection, the host does not perform any matching for security settings before forwarding the candidate BSS list to the adapter.
