# Management filtering layer identifiers

The management filtering layer identifiers are generally used by user-mode applications and are each represented by a GUID, which is 128 bits in size. These identifiers are defined as follows.

> [!NOTE]
> The V4 and V6 suffixes at the end of the layer identifiers indicate whether the layer is located in the IPv4 network stack or in the IPv6 network stack.
