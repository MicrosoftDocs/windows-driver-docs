# Hyper-V Extensible Switch Ports Topics


This section includes the following topics that describe the characteristics of Hyper-V extensible switch ports:

[Overview of Hyper-V Extensible Switch Ports](overview-of-hyper-v-extensible-switch-ports.md)

[Validation Ports](validation-ports.md)

[Operational Ports](operational-ports.md)

**Note**  NDIS ports and extensible switch ports are different objects. Packets that move through the extensible switch data path are always assigned to the NDIS port number of **NDIS\_DEFAULT\_PORT\_NUMBER**. However, the packet's source and destination extensible switch port number can be a value of **NDIS\_SWITCH\_DEFAULT\_PORT\_ID** or greater. For more information, see [Hyper-V Extensible Switch Data Path](hyper-v-extensible-switch-data-path.md).
