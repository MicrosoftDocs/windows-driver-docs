# MB 5G Operations Overview

Windows 10, version 1903 is the first version of Windows to support a preview release of 5G mobile broadband driver development by IHV partners. *5G* is the friendly name for New Radio (NR), which was introduced in the [3GPP Release 15 specification](https://www.3gpp.org/release-15). NR is a comprehensive set of standards that is envisioned to provide true long-term evolution to existing 4th generation LTE technologies, potentially covering all cellular communication needs from narrowband to ultra-broadband, and from nominal to mission-critical latency requirements. As a technology, 5G is expected to develop over a decade-long time frame. 

This section describes the MBIM extensions first released in Windows 10 version 1903, which enable hardware partners to develop an MBB driver with data-class support for enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) over 5G “non-standalone” EPC-based NR networks. The data-plane support and enablement for 5G throughput and commercialization requirements are not part of this Windows release and not described in this section.
