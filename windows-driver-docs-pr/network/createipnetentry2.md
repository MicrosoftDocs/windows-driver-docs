# CreateIpNetEntry2 function

The **CreateIpNetEntry2** function creates a new neighbor IP address entry on the local computer.

## Syntax

``` c++
NETIOAPI_API CreateIpNetEntry2(
  _In_Â const MIB_IPNET_ROW2 *Row
);
```

## Parameters

- *Row* \[in\]  
   A pointer to a [**MIB\_IPNET\_ROW2**](mib-ipnet-row2.md) structure entry for an IP route entry.

## Return value

**CreateIpNetEntry2** returns STATUS\_SUCCESS if the function succeeds.

If the function fails, **CreateIpNetEntry2** returns one of the following error codes:

<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Return code</th>

<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER</strong></td>
<td><p>An invalid parameter was passed to the function. This error is returned if one of the following items occurs:</p>

<td><strong>STATUS_NOT_FOUND</strong></td>

<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>STATUS_NOT_SUPPORTED</strong></td>

</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><strong>ERROR_OBJECT_ALREADY_EXISTS</strong></td>
<td><p>The object already exists. This error is returned if the <strong>Address</strong> member of the MIB_IPNET_ROW2 structure that the <em>Row</em> parameter points to is a duplicate of an existing neighbor IP address on the interface that is specified by the <strong>InterfaceLuid</strong> or <strong>InterfaceIndex</strong> member of the MIB_IPNET_ROW2 structure.</p></td>

## Remarks

Your driver must initialize the following members of the [**MIB\_IPNET\_ROW2**](mib-ipnet-row2.md) structure that the *Row* parameter points to:

- Set the **Address** member to a valid unicast, anycast, or multicast IPv4 or IPv6 address and family.

- Set the **PhysicalAddress** and **PhysicalAddressLength** members in the MIB\_IPNET\_ROW2 structure to a valid physical address.

- Set **InterfaceLuid** or **InterfaceIndex** to the LUID or index value of the interface.

The **InterfaceLuid** and **InterfaceIndex** members are used in the order that is listed earlier. So if the **InterfaceLuid** is specified, this member is used to determine the interface to add the unicast IP address on. If no value was set for the **InterfaceLuid** member (the value of this member was set to zero), the **InterfaceIndex** member is next used to determine the interface.

The **CreateIpNetEntry2** function fails if the IP address that is passed in the **Address** member of the MIB\_IPNET\_ROW2 structure that the *Row* parameter points to is a duplicate of an existing neighbor IP address on the interface.
