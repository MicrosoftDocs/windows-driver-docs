| [**WDI\_CIPHER\_ALGORITHM**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wditypes/ne-wditypes-_wdi_cipher_algorithm) | The multicast management cipher algorithm that the port negotiated with the peer during association.                                                                                                                                                |
| UINT8                                                       | Specifies if the port has associated with a peer that supports distribution system (DS) services for ISO Layer 2 bridging on any station in the BSS network, including mobile stations and APs. This value should be set to 1 if this is supported. |
| UINT8                                                       | Specifies whether the port has performed port authorization during the association operation.                                                                                                                                                       |

| WDI\_BAND\_ID (UINT32)                                      | The band ID on which the association is established.                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| UINT32                                                      | The IHV association status. If the association failed, this can contain an IHV-defined status code. This is only used for debugging purpose.                                                                                                        |
