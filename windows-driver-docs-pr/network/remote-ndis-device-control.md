# Remote NDIS Device Control





The host uses REMOTE\_NDIS\_QUERY\_MSG and REMOTE\_NDIS\_SET\_MSG to control the operation of the Remote NDIS device. An NDIS object ID (OID) is used with each such message to identify a device operational parameter or statistics counter. The lists of [Remote NDIS OIDs](remote-ndis-oids.md) are broken down into two groups: *general OID* and *802.3-specific OID*. Additionally, each group includes a subsection of statistic OID queries. The general OIDs are required of any networking device.
