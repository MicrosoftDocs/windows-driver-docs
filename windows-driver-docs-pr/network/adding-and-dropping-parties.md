# Adding and Dropping Parties





A connection-oriented client can add a party to an outgoing multipoint call that it initiated with [**NdisClMakeCall**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff561635). A connection-oriented client can also delete a party from a multipoint call either at its own discretion or at the request of the remote party to be dropped.

This section includes:

[Adding a Party to a Multipoint Call](adding-a-party-to-a-multipoint-call.md)

[Dropping a Party from a Multipoint Call](dropping-a-party-from-a-multipoint-call.md)

[Incoming Request to Drop a Party from a Multipoint Call](incoming-request-to-drop-a-party-from-a-multipoint-call.md)
