# Halting a Miniport Adapter





NDIS calls an NDIS miniport driver's [*MiniportHaltEx*](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ndis/nc-ndis-miniport_halt) function to deallocate resources when an adapter is removed from the system, and to stop the hardware. NDIS can call *MiniportHaltEx* after the driver's [*MiniportInitializeEx*](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ndis/nc-ndis-miniport_initialize) function returns successfully. For more information about *MiniportInitializeEx*, see [Initializing a Miniport Adapter](initializing-a-miniport-adapter.md).

[*MiniportHaltEx*](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ndis/nc-ndis-miniport_halt) must free any resources that the driver allocated for a device. The driver must call the reciprocals of the **Ndis<em>Xxx</em>** functions with which it originally allocated the resources. As a general rule, a *MiniportHaltEx* function should call the reciprocal **Ndis<em>Xxx</em>** functions in the reverse order used during initialization.

If an adapter generates interrupts, a miniport driver's [*MiniportHaltEx*](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ndis/nc-ndis-miniport_halt) function can be preempted by the driver's [*MiniportInterrupt*](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ndis/nc-ndis-miniport_isr) function until *MiniportHaltEx* disables interrupts.

NDIS does not call [*MiniportHaltEx*](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ndis/nc-ndis-miniport_halt) if there are outstanding OID requests or send requests. NDIS submits no further requests for the affected device after NDIS calls *MiniportHaltEx*.

After [*MiniportHaltEx*](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ndis/nc-ndis-miniport_halt) returns, the miniport driver is in the Halted state.
