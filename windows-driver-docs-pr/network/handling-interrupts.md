# Handling interrupts for NDIS miniport drivers





NDIS calls the [*MiniportInterrupt*](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ndis/nc-ndis-miniport_isr) function when a NIC, or another device that shares the interrupt with the NIC, generates an interrupt.

*MiniportInterrupt* should return **FALSE** immediately if the underlying NIC did not generate the interrupt. Otherwise, it returns **TRUE** after processing the interrupt.

A miniport driver should do as little work as possible in its *MiniportInterrupt* function. It should defer I/O operations to the [*MiniportInterruptDPC*](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ndis/nc-ndis-miniport_interrupt_dpc) function. NDIS calls *MiniportInterruptDPC* to complete the deferred processing of an interrupt.

To queue additional DPCs after *MiniportInterrupt* returns, the miniport driver sets the bits of the [**TargetProcessors**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ndis/nf-ndis-ndismqueuedpc) parameter of the *MiniportInterrupt* function. To request additional DPCs from *MiniportInterrupt* or *MiniportInterruptDPC*, the miniport driver calls the **NdisMQueueDpc** function.

The miniport driver can call **NdisMQueueDpc** to request additional DPC calls for other processors.
