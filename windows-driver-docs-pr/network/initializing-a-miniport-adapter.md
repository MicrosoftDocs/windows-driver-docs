# Initializing a Miniport Adapter





When a networking device becomes available, the system loads the required NDIS miniport driver, if it is not already loaded. Subsequently, the Plug and Play (PnP) manager sends NDIS a Plug and Play IRP to start the device. NDIS calls the miniport driver's [*MiniportInitializeEx*](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ndis/nc-ndis-miniport_initialize) function to initialize an adapter for network I/O operations. NDIS can call *MiniportInitializeEx* at any time after the driver is initialized. For more information about miniport driver initialization, see [Initializing a Miniport Driver](initializing-a-miniport-driver.md).

Until [*MiniportInitializeEx*](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ndis/nc-ndis-miniport_initialize) returns, NDIS submits no requests for the adapter being initialized. The adapter is in the Initializing state.

A miniport driver typically performs the following tasks in [*MiniportInitializeEx*](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ndis/nc-ndis-miniport_initialize):

1.  Obtains configuration information for the adapter.

2.  Obtains information about the hardware resources for the adapter.

3.  Calls the [**NdisMSetMiniportAttributes**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ndis/nf-ndis-ndismsetminiportattributes) and provides the following attributes that are associated with the adapter:
    -   A pointer to a driver-allocated context area.
    -   Appropriate attributes flags.
    -   The time-out interval for calling its [*MiniportCheckForHangEx*](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ndis/nc-ndis-miniport_check_for_hang) function.
    -   The interface type.

4.  Initializes adapter-specific resources.

The miniport driver specifies the adapter attributes in the [**NDIS\_MINIPORT\_ADAPTER\_ATTRIBUTES**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ndis/ns-ndis-_ndis_miniport_adapter_attributes) structure that [*MiniportInitializeEx*](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ndis/nc-ndis-miniport_initialize) passes to [**NdisMSetMiniportAttributes**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ndis/nf-ndis-ndismsetminiportattributes).

Typically, [*MiniportInitializeEx*](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ndis/nc-ndis-miniport_initialize) allocates adapter-specific resources in the following order:

1.  Nonpaged pool memory.

2.  [**NET\_BUFFER**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/nbl/ns-nbl-net_buffer) and [**NET\_BUFFER\_LIST**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/nbl/ns-nbl-net_buffer_list) pools (see [Miniport Driver Send and Receive Operations](miniport-driver-send-and-receive-operations.md)).

3.  Spin locks.

4.  Timers.

5.  IO ports.

6.  DMA (see [Scatter/Gather DMA](./ndis-scatter-gather-dma.md)).

7.  Shared memory.

8.  Interrupts (see [Managing Interrupts](registering-and-deregistering-interrupts.md)).

After [*MiniportInitializeEx*](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ndis/nc-ndis-miniport_initialize) returns successfully, the adapter is in the Paused state. NDIS can call the [**MiniportRestart**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ndis/nc-ndis-miniport_restart) function to transition the adapter to the Running state. For more information, see [Starting a Miniport Adapter](starting-an-adapter.md).

If [*MiniportInitializeEx*](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ndis/nc-ndis-miniport_initialize) returns NDIS\_STATUS\_SUCCESS, the driver should release all the resources for the adapter in the [*MiniportHaltEx*](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ndis/nc-ndis-miniport_halt) function. For more information, see [Halting a Miniport Adapter](halting-a-miniport-adapter.md).

The driver must call **NdisMSetMiniportAttributes** and set the **GeneralAttributes** in the **NDIS_MINIPORT_ADAPTER_ATTRIBUTES** structure if it returns NDIS_STATUS_SUCCESS.

If [*MiniportInitializeEx*](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ndis/nc-ndis-miniport_initialize) failed, *MiniportInitializeEx* must release all resources that it allocated before it returns and the adapter returns to the Halted state.
