# Starting and Pausing a Filter Module





NDIS pauses a filter module to stop data flow that could interfere with Plug and Play operations, for example, adding or removing a filter module in a driver stack, or to add a new binding. For more information about how to modify a running driver stack, see [Modifying a Running Driver Stack](modifying-a-running-driver-stack.md).

NDIS starts a filter module from the *Paused* state. The filter module enters the *Paused* state after the attach operation is complete or after a pause operation is complete.

The following topics provide more information about starting and pausing a filter module:
