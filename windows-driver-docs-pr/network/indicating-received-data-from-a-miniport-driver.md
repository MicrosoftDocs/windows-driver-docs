# Indicating Received Data from a Miniport Driver





The following figure illustrates a miniport driver receive indication.

:::image type="content" source="images/miniportreceive.png" alt-text="Diagram illustrating a miniport driver receive indication.":::

Miniport drivers call the [**NdisMIndicateReceiveNetBufferLists**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ndis/nf-ndis-ndismindicatereceivenetbufferlists) function to indicate the receipt of data from the network. The **NdisMIndicateReceiveNetBufferLists** function passes the indicated list of [**NET\_BUFFER\_LIST**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/nbl/ns-nbl-net_buffer_list) structures up the stack to overlying drivers.

If a miniport driver sets the **NDIS\_RECEIVE\_FLAGS\_RESOURCES** flag in the *ReceiveFlags* parameter of [**NdisMIndicateReceiveNetBufferLists**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ndis/nf-ndis-ndismindicatereceivenetbufferlists), this indicates that the miniport driver must regain ownership of the [**NET\_BUFFER\_LIST**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/nbl/ns-nbl-net_buffer_list) structures immediately. In this case, NDIS does not call the miniport driver's [*MiniportReturnNetBufferLists*](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ndis/nc-ndis-miniport_return_net_buffer_lists) function to return the **NET\_BUFFER\_LIST** structures. The miniport driver regains ownership immediately after **NdisMIndicateReceiveNetBufferLists** returns.

If a miniport driver does not set the **NDIS\_RECEIVE\_FLAGS\_RESOURCES** flag in the *ReceiveFlags* parameter of [**NdisMIndicateReceiveNetBufferLists**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ndis/nf-ndis-ndismindicatereceivenetbufferlists), NDIS returns the indicated [**NET\_BUFFER\_LIST**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/nbl/ns-nbl-net_buffer_list) structures to the miniport driver's [*MiniportReturnNetBufferLists*](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ndis/nc-ndis-miniport_return_net_buffer_lists) function. In this case, the miniport driver relinquishes ownership of the indicated structures until NDIS returns them to *MiniportReturnNetBufferLists*.
