# NDIS\_STATUS\_WWAN\_SIGNAL\_STATE


Miniport drivers use the NDIS\_STATUS\_WWAN\_SIGNAL\_STATE notification to send a signal strength notification when measured signal strength travels outside the threshold within a pre-defined interval.

Miniport drivers can also send unsolicited events with this notification.

This notification uses the [**NDIS\_WWAN\_SIGNAL\_STATE**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ndiswwan/ns-ndiswwan-_ndis_wwan_signal_state) structure.

## Remarks

By default, miniport drivers must notify the MB Service if the Rssi value changes by at least +/-5 decibels from the last reported value, or at a maximum frequency of one indication every 5 seconds. The threshold value is specified in the **SignalState.RssiThreshold** member of the NDIS\_WWAN\_SIGNAL\_STATE structure; while the maximum frequency value is specified in the **SignalState.RssiInterval** member.

The **DeviceCaps.WwanCellularClass** member of the NDIS\_WWAN\_DEVICE\_CAPS structure controls how the Rssi value will be interpreted by the MB Service. If **WwanCellularClass** is **WwanCellularClassGSM**, Rssi is reported as decibels above the device's sensitivity noise floor. If **WwanCellularClass** is **WwanCellularClassCDMA**, Rssi is reported as compensated RSSI (accounts for noise).

Applications should never poll for signal strength. Only in special situations, such as startup, an application might use a *query* request to obtain signal strength.
