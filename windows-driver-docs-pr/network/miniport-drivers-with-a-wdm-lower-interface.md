# Overview of Miniport Drivers with a WDM Lower Interface





A miniport driver with a Microsoft [Windows Driver Model](../kernel/writing-wdm-drivers.md) (WDM) lower interface is also known as an *NDIS-WDM miniport driver*. This type of miniport driver:

-   Uses a WDM lower edge.

-   Can call both NDIS and non-NDIS functions. However, whenever possible, the miniport driver should call NDIS functions.

-   Can initialize a miniport instance that is used to control devices that are attached to a particular bus and that communicates with those devices over that bus.

For example, a miniport driver that controls devices on either Universal Serial Bus (USB) or IEEE 1394 (Firewire) buses must expose a standard NDIS miniport driver interface at its upper edge and use the class interface for the particular bus at its lower edge. Such a miniport driver communicates with devices that are attached to the bus by sending I/O request packets (IRPs) to the bus.

The following topics describe how to implement a miniport driver that uses a WDM lower edge:
