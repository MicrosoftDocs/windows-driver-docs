# Implementing an NDIS 6.40 Driver


An NDIS 6.40 driver must follow the requirements that are defined in [Implementing an NDIS 6.30 Driver](implementing-an-ndis-6-30-driver.md).

In addition, an NDIS 6.40 driver must be compliant with the following requirements:

-   An NDIS 6.40 driver must report the correct NDIS version when it registers with NDIS.

    * You must update the major and minor NDIS version number in the NDIS\_*Xxx*\_DRIVER\_CHARACTERISTICS structure to support NDIS 6.40. The **MajorNdisVersion** member must contain **6** and the **MinorNdisVersion** member must contain **40**. This requirement applies to miniport, protocol, and filter drivers. You must also update the version information for the compiler, see [Compiling an NDIS 6.40 Driver](compiling-an-ndis-6-40-driver.md).

    * Miniport drivers must set the **Header** member of [**NDIS_MINIPORT_DRIVER_CHARACTERISTICS**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ndis/ns-ndis-_ndis_miniport_driver_characteristics): Set **Revision** to NDIS_MINIPORT_DRIVER_CHARACTERISTICS_REVISION_2 and **Size** to NDIS_SIZEOF_MINIPORT_DRIVER_CHARACTERISTICS_REVISION_2. 

    * Filter drivers must set the **Header** member of [**NDIS_FILTER_DRIVER_CHARACTERISTICS**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ndis/ns-ndis-_ndis_filter_driver_characteristics): Set **Revision** to NDIS_FILTER_CHARACTERISTICS_REVISION_2 and **Size** to NDIS_SIZEOF_FILTER_DRIVER_CHARACTERISTICS_REVISION_2. 

    * Protocol drivers must set the **Header** member of [**NDIS_PROTOCOL_DRIVER_CHARACTERISTICS**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ndis/ns-ndis-_ndis_protocol_driver_characteristics): Set **Revision** to NDIS_PROTOCOL_CHARACTERISTICS_REVISION_2 and **Size** to NDIS_SIZEOF_PROTOCOL _DRIVER_CHARACTERISTICS_REVISION_2.

-   NDIS 6.40 miniport drivers for the Windows 8.1 and Windows Server 2012 R2 operating systems must use the NDIS 6.40 versions of data structures. For more information, see [Using NDIS 6.40 Data Structures](using-ndis-6-40-data-structures.md).
