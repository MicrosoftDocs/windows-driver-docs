# MiniportAddDevice Guidelines for PF Miniport Drivers


This topic describes the guidelines for writing a [*MiniportAddDevice*](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ndis/nc-ndis-miniport_add_device) function for the miniport driver of the PCI Express (PCIe) Physical Function (PF). The PF is a component of a network adapter that supports single root I/O virtualization (SR-IOV).

**Note**  These guidelines only apply to PF miniport drivers. For initialization guidelines for the miniport driver of a PCIe Virtual Function (VF) of the adapter, see [Initializing a VF Miniport Driver](initializing-a-vf-miniport-driver.md).

 

The Plug and Play (PnP) Manager calls the NDIS [*AddDevice*](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nc-wdm-driver_add_device) function to create the functional device object (FDO) for the network adapter. If the PF miniport driver registered a [*MiniportAddDevice*](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ndis/nc-ndis-miniport_add_device) entry point when it called [**NdisMRegisterMiniportDriver**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ndis/nf-ndis-ndismregisterminiportdriver), NDIS calls the driver's *MiniportAddDevice* function.

When [*MiniportAddDevice*](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ndis/nc-ndis-miniport_add_device) is called, the PF miniport driver can allocate additional software resources for the SR-IOV and the network interface card (NIC) switch. Typically, these are resources that must be allocated before NDIS calls the driver's [*MiniportInitializeEx*](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ndis/nc-ndis-miniport_initialize) function.

The driver can do the following within the context of the call to [*MiniportAddDevice*](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ndis/nc-ndis-miniport_add_device):

-   The PF miniport driver can call [**NdisReadConfiguration**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ndis/nf-ndis-ndisreadconfiguration) to read the SR-IOV and NIC switch configuration settings from the registry. These configuration settings are defined through the standardized SR-IOV keywords. For more information about these keywords, see [Standardized INF Keywords for SR-IOV](standardized-inf-keywords-for-sr-iov.md).

-   Based on these configuration settings, the PF miniport driver allocates the additional software resources for the SR-IOV network adapter.

**Note**  The actual allocation of hardware resources and the enabling of SR-IOV in the PCI configuration space must only be done within the context of the call to [*MiniportInitializeEx*](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ndis/nc-ndis-miniport_initialize). Because the network adapter's memory-mapped I/O (MMIO) space is uninitialized when [*MiniportAddDevice*](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ndis/nc-ndis-miniport_add_device) is called, the miniport driver must not read or write to the adapter until *MiniportInitializeEx* is called.
