# OID\_WWAN\_DELETE\_MAC


OID\_WWAN\_DELETE\_MAC requests the miniport driver to delete the NDIS port specified in the NDIS\_WWAN\_MAC\_INFO parameter. The NDIS port should have been created earlier using [OID\_WWAN\_CREATE\_MAC](oid-wwan-create-mac.md).

Miniport drivers must process the set request asynchronously, initially returning NDIS\_STATUS\_PENDING to the original request, and later completing the request with NDIS\_STATUS\_SUCCESS.

Query requests are not supported.

## Remarks

Miniport drivers must process requests to delete (deactivate) NDIS ports asynchronously in order to prevent deadlocks.

OID\_WWAN\_DELETE\_MAC requests sent to delete the default port will fail with the NDIS status error code NDIS\_STATUS\_INVALID\_PORT.

Upon receiving an OID\_WWAN\_DELETE\_MAC request, miniport drivers should deactivate the PDP context associated with the port, if it has not already been deactivated. This is because a surprise removal event could occur. Deactivating the PDP context at such time will ensure that the modem and the miniport driver remain in a good state.

When the driver receives a surprise removal, the driver blocks and cancels all further OIDs. This means that the driver filters out OID\_WWAN\_DELETE\_MAC even though Windows sends a call with OID\_WWAN\_DELETE\_MAC as part of the [*FILTER\_DETACH*](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ndis/nc-ndis-filter_detach) call.
