# OID\_WWAN\_SUBSCRIBE\_DEVICE\_SERVICE\_EVENTS


OID\_WWAN\_SUBSCRIBE\_DEVICE\_SERVICE\_EVENTS sets information about the list of device services for which the MB device must send [**NDIS\_STATUS\_WWAN\_DEVICE\_SERVICE\_EVENT**](./ndis-status-wwan-device-service-event.md) notifications. The MB device should not indicate events for any device service which is not in this list.

Miniport drivers must process set requests asynchronously, initially returning NDIS\_STATUS\_INDICATION\_REQUIRED to the original request, and later sending a [**NDIS\_STATUS\_WWAN\_DEVICE\_SERVICE\_SUBSCRIPTION**](./ndis-status-wwan-device-service-subscription.md) status notification that contains the current list of event subscriptions on the MB device.

Callers requesting to set the MB device service event subscription list provide a [**NDIS\_WWAN\_SUBSCRIBE\_DEVICE\_SERVICE\_EVENTS**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ndiswwan/ns-ndiswwan-_ndis_wwan_subscribe_device_service_events) structure to the miniport driver with the appropriate information.
