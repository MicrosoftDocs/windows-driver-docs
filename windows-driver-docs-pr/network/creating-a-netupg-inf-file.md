# Creating a Netupg.inf File





**Note**  Vendor-supplied network upgrades are not supported in Microsoft Windows XP (SP1 and later), Microsoft Windows Server 2003, and later operating systems.

 

The netupg.inf file contains a single section called **OemNetUpgradeDirs**. Each entry in this section specifies the complete path to a directory that contains the vendor-supplied upgrade files for a non-Microsoft-supported network component. Every network component being upgraded must have a corresponding entry in the **OemNetUpgradeDirs** section.

The following is an example of a netupg.inf file:

```INF
[OemNetUpgradeDirs]
c:\temp\adapter1
c:\temp\adapter2
c:\temp\protocol1
c:\temp\netclient1
c:\temp\netservice1
```

Each directory specified in the **OemNetUpgradeDirs** section must contain a netmap.inf file. This file, which is provided by the vendor of the network component, maps the preupgrade device, hardware or compatible ID of a network component to the corresponding ID in the upgraded operating system.
