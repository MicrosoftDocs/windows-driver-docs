# Callout Driver


A *callout driver* is a kernel-mode driver that implements one or more [callouts](callout.md). A callout driver registers its callouts with the [filter engine](filter-engine.md) so that the filter engine can call the [callout functions](callout-function.md) for the callout when the computer processes connections or packets.
