# OID\_PNP\_ENABLE\_WAKE\_UP





As a set, the OID\_PNP\_ENABLE\_WAKE\_UP OID specifies the wake-up capabilities that a miniport driver should enable in a network adapter.

As a query, OID\_PNP\_ENABLE\_WAKE\_UP obtains the current wake-up capabilities that are enabled for a network adapter.

The **InformationBuffer** member of the [**NDIS\_OID\_REQUEST**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/oidrequest/ns-oidrequest-ndis_oid_request) structure is a bitmask of flags that can be used to enable a combination of wake-up events:

<a href="" id="ndis-pnp-wake-up-magic-packet"></a>**NDIS\_PNP\_WAKE\_UP\_MAGIC\_PACKET**  
When set, specifies that the miniport driver should enable a network adapter to signal a wake-up event on receipt of a magic packet. (A *magic packet* is a packet that contains 16 contiguous copies of the receiving network adapter's Ethernet address.) When cleared, specifies that the miniport driver should disable the network adapter from signaling such a wake-up event.

<a href="" id="ndis-pnp-wake-up-pattern-match"></a>**NDIS\_PNP\_WAKE\_UP\_PATTERN\_MATCH**  
When set, specifies that the miniport driver should enable a network adapter to signal a wake-up event on receipt of a packet that contains a pattern specified by the protocol with [OID\_PNP\_ADD\_WAKE\_UP\_PATTERN](oid-pnp-add-wake-up-pattern.md). When cleared, specifies that the miniport driver should disable the network adapter from signaling such a wake-up event.

<a href="" id="ndis-pnp-wake-up-link-change"></a>**NDIS\_PNP\_WAKE\_UP\_LINK\_CHANGE**  
Reserved. NDIS ignores this flag.

A protocol driver uses the network adapter's wake-up capabilities in [**NDIS\_BIND\_PARAMETERS**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ndis/ns-ndis-_ndis_bind_parameters) to enable the associated network adapter's wake-up capabilities. A protocol driver can also query this OID to determine which wake-up capabilities are enabled for a network adapter.

NDIS does not immediately enable the wake-up capabilities that a protocol driver specifies. Instead, NDIS keeps tracks of the wake-up capabilities that the protocol driver enabled and, just before the network adapter transitions to a low-power state, NDIS sends an OID\_PNP\_ENABLE\_WAKE\_UP set request to the miniport driver to enable the appropriate wake-up events.

Before the network adapter transitions to a low-power state (that is, before NDIS sends the miniport driver an [OID\_PNP\_SET\_POWER](oid-pnp-set-power.md) request), NDIS sends the miniport driver an OID\_PNP\_ENABLE\_WAKE\_UP request to enable the appropriate wake-up capabilities.

The miniport driver must take the appropriate device-dependent steps to enable or disable wake-up events on the network adapter.

The miniport driver should clear the wake-up capabilities that NDIS set with OID\_PNP\_ENABLE\_WAKE\_UP when the system is resumed. The wake-up capabilities should not be persisted across resumes. If wake-up capabilities are enabled, NDIS explicitly sets OID\_PNP\_ENABLE\_WAKE\_UP before the miniport transitions to the low-power state.

An intermediate driver in which the upper edge receives this OID request must always propagate the request to the underlying miniport driver by calling the [**NdisOidRequest**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ndis/nf-ndis-ndisoidrequest) or [**NdisCoOidRequest**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ndis/nf-ndis-ndiscooidrequest) function.
