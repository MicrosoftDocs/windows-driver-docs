# Shared Memory in Receive Buffers





This section describes the layout of the shared memory in VMQ receive buffers.For more information about using the buffers in receive indications, see [VMQ Receive Path](vmq-receive-path.md).

If the overlying protocol driver set the NDIS\_RECEIVE\_QUEUE\_PARAMETERS\_LOOKAHEAD\_SPLIT\_REQUIRED flag in the **Flags** member of the [**NDIS\_RECEIVE\_QUEUE\_PARAMETERS**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ntddndis/ns-ntddndis-_ndis_receive_queue_parameters) structure, the network adapter should split a received packet at an offset equal to or greater than the requested lookahead size and use DMA to transfer the lookahead data and the post-lookahead data to separate shared memory segments.

Miniport drivers specify the settings for the lookahead type (**NdisSharedMemoryUsageReceiveLookahead**) or other shared memory types when the shared memory is allocated. For example, the miniport driver calls the [**NdisAllocateSharedMemory**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ndis/nf-ndis-ndisallocatesharedmemory) function and sets the **Usage** member in the [**NDIS\_SHARED\_MEMORY\_PARAMETERS**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ndis/ns-ndis-_ndis_shared_memory_parameters) structure to **NdisSharedMemoryUsageReceiveLookahead**. Miniport drivers should allocated shared memory for a queue when the queue allocation is complete. For information about allocating and freeing shared memory resources for queues, see [Shared Memory Resource Allocation](shared-memory-resource-allocation.md).

The following illustration shows the relationships for the network data when the incoming data is split into two shared memory buffers.

The [**NET\_BUFFER\_SHARED\_MEMORY**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/nbl/ns-nbl-net_buffer_shared_memory) structure specifies shared memory information. There can be a linked list of such shared memory buffers that are associated with a [**NET\_BUFFER**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/nbl/ns-nbl-net_buffer) structure.

Use the [**NET\_BUFFER\_SHARED\_MEM\_NEXT\_SEGMENT**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/nblaccessors/nf-nblaccessors-net_buffer_shared_mem_next_segment), [**NET\_BUFFER\_SHARED\_MEM\_FLAGS**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/nblaccessors/nf-nblaccessors-net_buffer_shared_mem_flags), [**NET\_BUFFER\_SHARED\_MEM\_HANDLE**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/nblaccessors/nf-nblaccessors-net_buffer_shared_mem_handle), [**NET\_BUFFER\_SHARED\_MEM\_OFFSET**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/nblaccessors/nf-nblaccessors-net_buffer_shared_mem_offset), and [**NET\_BUFFER\_SHARED\_MEM\_LENGTH**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/nblaccessors/nf-nblaccessors-net_buffer_shared_mem_length) macros to access the NET\_BUFFER\_SHARED\_MEMORY in a NET\_BUFFER structure. The **SharedMemoryInfo** member of the NET\_BUFFER structure contains the first NET\_BUFFER\_SHARED\_MEMORY structure in the linked list.

**Note**  Starting with NDIS 6.30, splitting packet data into separate lookahead buffers is no longer supported. Starting with Windows Server 2012, the overlying protocol driver will not set the **NDIS\_RECEIVE\_QUEUE\_PARAMETERS\_LOOKAHEAD\_SPLIT\_REQUIRED** flag in the **Flags** member of the [**NDIS\_RECEIVE\_QUEUE\_PARAMETERS**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ntddndis/ns-ntddndis-_ndis_receive_queue_parameters) structure.
