# Send and Receive Operations





In a single function call, NDIS 6.0 drivers can send multiple [**NET\_BUFFER\_LIST**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/nbl/ns-nbl-net_buffer_list) structures with multiple [**NET\_BUFFER**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/nbl/ns-nbl-net_buffer) structures on each NET\_BUFFER\_LIST structure. Also, NDIS drivers can indicate completed send operations for multiple NET\_BUFFER\_LIST structures with multiple NET\_BUFFER structures on a NET\_BUFFER\_LIST structure.

In the receive path, miniport drivers can use a list of NET\_BUFFER\_LIST structures to indicate receives. Each NET\_BUFFER\_LIST indicated by a miniport driver contains one NET\_BUFFER structure. However, Native 802.11 drivers can have more than one NET\_BUFFER structure. Because a different protocol binding can process each NET\_BUFFER\_LIST structure, NDIS can return each NET\_BUFFER\_LIST structure to the miniport driver independently.

To support NDIS 5.*x* and earlier drivers, NDIS provides a translation layer between the [**NDIS\_PACKET**](/previous-versions/windows/hardware/network/ff557086(v=vs.85))-based and NET\_BUFFER-based interfaces. NDIS performs the necessary conversion between [**NET\_BUFFER**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/nbl/ns-nbl-net_buffer) structures and NDIS\_PACKET structures. To avoid performance degradation due to translation, NDIS drivers must be updated to use NET\_BUFFER structures and should support multiple [**NET\_BUFFER\_LIST**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/nbl/ns-nbl-net_buffer_list) structures in all data paths.
