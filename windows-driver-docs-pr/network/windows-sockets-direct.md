# Windows Sockets Direct Overview





Microsoft Windows Sockets Direct is a technology that, when possible, routes data at high speed and with high performance to and from Windows Sockets applications through a system area network (SAN) instead of the TCP/IP transport and an NDIS miniport driver.

Windows Sockets Direct is included in:

-   Microsoft Windows 2000 Datacenter Server

-   Microsoft Windows 2000 Advanced Server SP2

-   Microsoft Windows 2000 Server Appliance Kit SP2

-   Microsoft Windows Server 2003

The following topics describe Windows Sockets Direct features and operations, the software components that enable Windows Sockets Direct, and the requirements for writing a SAN service provider and its associated proxy driver:
