# Interrupt Moderation





To reduce the number of interrupts, many NICs use *interrupt moderation*. With interrupt moderation, the NIC hardware will not generate an interrupt immediately after it receives a packet. Instead, the hardware waits for more packets to arrive, or for a time-out to expire, before generating an interrupt. The hardware vendor specifies the maximum number of packets, time-out interval, or other interrupt moderation algorithm.

The measured round-trip time for a packet is one of the most commonly used techniques to determine the network bandwidth between two endpoints. However, when interrupt moderation is enabled, receiving a packet does not generate an immediate interrupt and therefore the perceived round-trip time for a particular packet becomes larger than the average time. To allow accurate measurement of round trip time for a packet, NDIS provides the ability to disable and enable interrupt moderation on demand.

All NDIS 6.0 and later miniport drivers must support the [OID\_GEN\_INTERRUPT\_MODERATION](./oid-gen-interrupt-moderation.md) OID. If a miniport driver does not support interrupt moderation, the driver must specify **NdisInterruptModerationNotSupported** in the **InterruptModeration** member of the [**NDIS\_INTERRUPT\_MODERATION\_PARAMETERS**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ntddndis/ns-ntddndis-_ndis_interrupt_moderation_parameters) structure.

NDIS 6.0 and later miniport drivers must support both the [OID\_GEN\_INTERRUPT\_MODERATION](./oid-gen-interrupt-moderation.md) OID set and query requests. The set request directs the miniport driver to enable or disable interrupt moderation and the query request reports the current state of interrupt moderation.

A miniport driver that supports interrupt moderation should turn this capability on by default unless the **InterruptModeration** standard keyword in the registry disables it. For more information about the standard keywords, see [Standardized INF Keywords for Network Devices](standardized-inf-keywords-for-network-devices.md).
