# OID\_GEN\_VENDOR\_ID


As a query, the OID\_GEN\_VENDOR\_ID OID specifies a three-byte IEEE-registered vendor code, followed by a single byte that the vendor assigns to identify a particular NIC.

**Version Information**

<a href="" id="windows-vista-and-later-versions-of-windows"></a>Windows Vista and later versions of Windows  
Supported.

<a href="" id="ndis-6-0-and-later-miniport-drivers"></a>NDIS 6.0 and later miniport drivers  
Mandatory.

<a href="" id="ndis-5-1-miniport-drivers"></a>NDIS 5.1 miniport drivers  
Mandatory.

<a href="" id="windows-xp"></a>Windows XP  
Supported.

<a href="" id="ndis-5-1-miniport-drivers"></a>NDIS 5.1 miniport drivers  
Mandatory.

## Remarks

The IEEE code uniquely identifies the vendor and is the same as the three bytes appearing at the beginning of the NIC hardware address.

Vendors without an IEEE-registered code should use the value 0xFFFFFF.

Independent hardware vendor's filter drivers or intermediate drivers might query this OID.
