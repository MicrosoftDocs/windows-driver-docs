# Power Management for WDM Lower Edge





NDIS handles all Plug and Play (PnP) and power management IRPs for NDIS-WDM miniport drivers. Therefore, NDIS-WDM miniport drivers should respond to PnP and power management OIDs, based on device capabilities, as described in [Power Management for NDIS Miniport Drivers](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh205399). For more information about these OIDs, see [Power Management (NDIS 6.0 and Later)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh205399).
