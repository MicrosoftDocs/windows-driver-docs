# OID_TCP_TASK_IPSEC_DELETE_SA

The OID_TCP_TASK_IPSEC_DELETE_SA OID is set by a transport protocol to request that a miniport driver delete a security association (SA) from a NIC. The SA information is formatted as an [OFFLOAD_IPSEC_DELETE_SA](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ntddndis/ns-ntddndis-_offload_ipsec_delete_sa) structure.

On receiving this request, the miniport driver should delete the specified SA from the NIC and free any system resources allocated for the SA.

## Requirements

**Version**: Windows Vista and later
**Header**: Ntddndis.h (include Ndis.h)
