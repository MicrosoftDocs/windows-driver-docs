# MB Registration Operations


Miniport drivers use [OID\_WWAN\_REGISTER\_STATE](./oid-wwan-register-state.md) to process both *query* and *set* registration operations. For example, these operations may be to register with a network provider, query the registration state of the device with a provider's network, and send notifications when registration state changes.
