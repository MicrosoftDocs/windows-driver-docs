# MB Registration Operations


Miniport drivers use [OID\_WWAN\_REGISTER\_STATE](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff569834) to process both *query* and *set* registration operations. For example, these operations may be to register with a network provider, query the registration state of the device with a provider's network, and send notifications when registration state changes.
