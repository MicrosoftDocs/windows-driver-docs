# Transitioning to a Sleeping State





If a miniport driver supports wake-up events, NDIS sends the driver an [OID\_PNP\_ENABLE\_WAKE\_UP](./oid-pnp-enable-wake-up.md) request before sending an [OID\_PNP\_SET\_POWER](./oid-pnp-set-power.md) request. For more information, see [Enabling Wake-Up Events](enabling-wake-up-events.md). A miniport driver must not fail an OID\_PNP\_SET\_POWER request.

Before returning NDIS\_STATUS\_SUCCESS in response to an OID\_PNP\_SET\_POWER request, the miniport driver must:

-   Perform the device-dependent operations that are needed to prepare the network adapter for the sleeping state.

-   Save any packet filters, multicast addresses, the current MAC address, wake-up patterns, and any other hardware context that the network adapter cannot preserve in a sleeping state.

-   Disable interrupts and the network adapter's DMA engine. A miniport driver cannot access the network adapter hardware after the network adapter has been set to the D3 state by the bus driver.
