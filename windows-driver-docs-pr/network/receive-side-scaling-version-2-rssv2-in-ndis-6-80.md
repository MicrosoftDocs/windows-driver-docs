# Receive Side Scaling Version 2 (RSSv2) in NDIS 6.80

[!include[RSSv2 Beta Prerelease](../includes/rssv2-beta-prerelease.md)]

[Receive Side Scaling](./receive-side-scaling-version-2-rssv2-.md) improves the system performance related to handling of network data on multiprocessor systems. NDIS 6.80 and later support RSS Version 2 (RSSv2), which extends RSS by offering per-VPort spreading of queues.

RSSv2 uses the NDIS 6.80 Synchronous OID request interface for one of its OIDs. For more info about Synchronous OID calls, see [Synchronous OID request interface in NDIS 6.80](synchronous-oid-request-interface-in-ndis-6-80.md).

For more info about RSSv2, see [Receive Side Scaling Version 2 (RSSv2)](receive-side-scaling-version-2-rssv2-.md).
