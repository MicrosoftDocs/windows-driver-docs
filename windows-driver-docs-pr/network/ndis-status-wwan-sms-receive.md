# NDIS\_STATUS\_WWAN\_SMS\_RECEIVE


Miniport drivers use the NDIS\_STATUS\_WWAN\_SMS\_RECEIVE notification to inform the MB Service about either the completion of a previous read request through a [OID\_WWAN\_SMS\_READ](oid-wwan-sms-read.md)Â query request, or the arrival of a new class-0 (flash/alert) message from the network provider as an event notification.

Miniport drivers can also send unsolicited events with this notification.

This notification uses the [**NDIS\_WWAN\_SMS\_RECEIVE**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ndiswwan/ns-ndiswwan-_ndis_wwan_sms_receive) structure.

## Remarks

RequestId is set to "0" by the miniport driver to indicate the arrival of the new class-0 (flash/alert) message. Arrival of new class-0 (flash/alert) messages is dependent on the current network registration state.

If the request for read results in retrieval of large number of SMS records that can't be accommodated in a pre-allocated buffer of miniport driver, then the SMS records can be sent to the MB Service in multiple indications. The uStatus in this case must be set to WWAN\_STATUS\_SMS\_MORE\_DATA for the intermediate transactions and the final transaction must end with WWAN\_STATUS\_SUCCESS.

The following diagram represents the usage of the multiple indication method for large number of SMS record retrieval:
