# OID\_802\_3\_DELETE\_MULTICAST\_ADDRESS


As a set request, NDIS and overlying protocol drivers use the OID\_802\_3\_DELETE\_MULTICAST\_ADDRESS OID to delete a previously added multicast address from the multicast address list of a miniport adapter. The multicast address is an array of 6 bytes. Deleting an address disables that address so that it can no longer receive multicast packets.

**Version Information**

<a href="" id="windows-vista"></a>Windows Vista  
Supported.

<a href="" id="ndis-6-0-and-later-miniport-drivers"></a>NDIS 6.0 and later miniport drivers  
Not requested.

## Remarks

The **InformationBuffer** member of the [**NDIS\_OID\_REQUEST**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/oidrequest/ns-oidrequest-ndis_oid_request) structure contains the 6-byte address to be deleted from the multicast address list.

The OID\_802\_3\_DELETE\_MULTICAST\_ADDRESS OID request can delete only one address. To delete more than one address, the protocol driver must issue multiple OID\_802\_3\_DELETE\_MULTICAST\_ADDRESS OID requests.

NDIS miniport drivers do not receive this OID request directly. Instead, NDIS consolidates each sequence of [OID\_802\_3\_ADD\_MULTICAST\_ADDRESS](oid-802-3-add-multicast-address.md) and OID\_802\_3\_DELETE\_MULTICAST\_ADDRESS OID requests into a single [OID\_802\_3\_MULTICAST\_LIST](oid-802-3-multicast-list.md) OID request.

To replace or delete the entire multicast list, the protocol driver can use the [OID\_802\_3\_MULTICAST\_LIST](oid-802-3-multicast-list.md) OID request.

To add an address to the list, the protocol driver can use the [OID\_802\_3\_ADD\_MULTICAST\_ADDRESS](oid-802-3-add-multicast-address.md) OID request.

The overlying protocol driver can add a given multicast address multiple times by sending multiple [OID\_802\_3\_ADD\_MULTICAST\_ADDRESS](oid-802-3-add-multicast-address.md) OID requests. If NDIS succeeds the first add request for a given multicast address, NDIS will succeed all subsequent add requests for that address. To delete a multicast address that was added more than once, the overlying driver must delete the address the same number of times that it added the address.

### Return status codes

The miniport driver's [*MiniportOidRequest*](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ndis/nc-ndis-miniport_oid_request) function returns one of the following values for this request:
