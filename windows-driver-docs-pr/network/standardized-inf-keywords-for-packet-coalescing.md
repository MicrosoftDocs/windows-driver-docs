# Standardized INF Keywords for Packet Coalescing


A standardized INF keyword is defined to enable or disable support for packet coalescing on a miniport driver.

The INF file for the miniport driver of an adapter that supports packet coalescing must specify the **\*PacketCoalescing** standardized INF keyword. Once the driver is installed, administrators can update the **\*PacketCoalescing** keyword value in the **Advanced** property page for the adapter. For more information about advanced properties, see [Specifying Configuration Parameters for the Advanced Properties Page](specifying-configuration-parameters-for-the-advanced-properties-page.md).

**Note**   The miniport driver is automatically restarted after a change is made in the **Advanced** property page for the adapter.

 

The **\*PacketCoalescing** INF keyword is an enumeration keyword. The following table describes the possible INF entries for the **\*PacketCoalescing** INF keyword. The columns in this table describe the following attributes for an enumeration keyword:

<a href="" id="subkeyname"></a>SubkeyName  
The name of the keyword that you must specify in the INF file. This name also appears in the registry under the **NDI\\params\\** key for the network adapter.

<a href="" id="paramdesc"></a>ParamDesc  
The display text that is associated with SubkeyName.

**Note**  The independent hardware vendor (IHV) can define any descriptive text for the SubkeyName.

 

<a href="" id="value"></a>Value  
The enumeration integer value that is associated with each SubkeyName in the list.

<a href="" id="enumdesc"></a>EnumDesc  
The display text that is associated with each value that appears in the menu.

The miniport driver must check the **\*PacketCoalescing** keyword value in the registry before it advertises its support for packet coalescing. If the **\*PacketCoalescing** keyword has a value of zero, the miniport must not advertise support for any packet coalescing capabilities. For more information, see [Reporting Packet Coalescing Capabilities](reporting-packet-coalescing-capabilities.md).
