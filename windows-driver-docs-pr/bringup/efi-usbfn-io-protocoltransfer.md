# EFI_USBFN_IO_PROTOCOL.Transfer

The *Transfer* function handles transferring data to or from the host on the specified endpoint.

| Direction | Description |
|--|--|
| EfiUsbEndpointDirectionDeviceTx | Start a transmit transfer on the specified endpoint and return immediately. |
| EfiUsbEndpointDirectionDeviceRx | Start a receive transfer on the specified endpoint and return immediately with available data. |

## Syntax

```cpp
typedef
EFI_STATUS
(EFIAPI *EFI_USBFN_IO_TRANSFER) (
  IN EFI_USBFN_IO_PROTOCOL         *This,
  IN UINT8                         EndpointIndex,
  IN EFI_USBFN_ENDPOINT_DIRECTION  Direction,
  IN OUT UINTN                     *BufferSize,
  IN OUT VOID                      *Buffer
  );
```

## Parameters

*This*  
A pointer to the EFI_USBFN_IO_PROTOCOL instance.

*EndpointIndex*  
Indicates the endpoint on which TX or RX transfer needs to take place.

*Direction*  
Direction of the endpoint. For more information, see [EFI_USBFN_ENDPOINT_DIRECTION](efi-usbfn-endpoint-direction.md).

*BufferSize*  
If Direction is **EfiUsbEndpointDirectionDeviceRx**: On input, the size of the buffer in bytes. On output, the amount of data returned in the buffer in bytes. If Direction is **EfiUsbEndpointDirectionDeviceTx**: On input, the size of the Buffer in bytes. On output, the amount of data actually transmitted in bytes.

*Buffer*  
If Direction is **EfiUsbEndpointDirectionDeviceRx**:The buffer to return the received data. If Direction is **EfiUsbEndpointDirectionDeviceTx**: The buffer that contains the data to be transmitted.

This buffer is allocated and freed by using the AllocateTransferBuffer and FreeTransferBuffer functions. The caller of this function must not free or reuse the buffer until an **EfiUsbMsgEndpointStatusChangedRx** or **EfiUsbMsgEndpointStatusChangedTx** message was received along with the address of the transfer buffer as part of the message payload. See [EFI_USBFN_IO_PROTOCOL.EventHandler](efi-usbfn-io-protocoleventhandler.md) for more information on various messages and their payloads.

## Return values

The function returns one of the following values:

| Return code | Description |
|--|--|
| EFI_SUCCESS | The function returned successfully |
| EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER | A parameter is invalid |
| EFI_DEVICE_ERROR | The physical device reported an error. |
| EFI_NOT_READY | The physical device is busy or not ready to process this request |

## Remarks

A class driver must call [EFI_USBFN_IO_PROTOCOL.EventHandler](efi-usbfn-io-protocoleventhandler.md) repeatedly to receive updates on the transfer status and number of bytes transferred on various endpoints. Upon update on transfer status, the *Buffer* field of the [EFI_USBFN_TRANSFER_RESULT](efi-usbfn-transfer-result.md) structure must be initialized with the Buffer pointer that was supplied to this method. This function fails with EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER return code if the specified direction is incorrect for the endpoint.

The overview of the call sequence is illustrated in [UEFI Sequence Diagram](uefi-sequence-diagram.md).

This function fails with EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER return code if the specified direction is incorrect for the endpoint.
