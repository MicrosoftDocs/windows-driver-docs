# New method - Windows 10, version 1703 and later


Microsoft has made a new Mbr2gpt.exe tool available to convert Legacy MBR disk to GPT disk in a non-destructive conversion. 

[Mbr2gpt.exe](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/itpro/windows/deploy/mbr-to-gpt) facilitates migrating from a Legacy BIOS configuration to full UEFI on qualified systems in a non-destructive fashion.

Previous methods are considered a destructive conversion as the technician, application, or process must wipe the disk before converting the disk to a GPT disk.
