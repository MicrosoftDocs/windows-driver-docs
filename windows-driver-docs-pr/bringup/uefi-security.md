# UEFI security


Windows operating systems depend on the integrity and configuration of the firmware and hardware components in order to provide a secure work environment.

This section is intended as a guide to provide pointers to the information that will enable you to implement and validate security features in the firmware for Windows operating systems.

The following sections describe components of the firmware used to enable a more secure firmware, and a more secure operating system. This will also cover highlights of the components and provide pointers and links to existing online resources where available.
