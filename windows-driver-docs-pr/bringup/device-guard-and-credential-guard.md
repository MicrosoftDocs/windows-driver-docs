# Hypervisor-Protected Code Integrity (HVCI)

Hypervisor-Protected Code Integrity can use hardware technology and virtualization to isolate the Code Integrity (CI) decision-making function from the rest of the Windows operating system. When using virtualization-based security to isolate Code Integrity, the only way kernel memory can become executable is through a Code Integrity verification.
