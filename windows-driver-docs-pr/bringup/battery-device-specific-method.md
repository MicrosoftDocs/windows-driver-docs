# Battery Device-Specific Method

To support the passive thermal management of the battery by the platform, Microsoft defines a _DSM method to communicate to the platform firmware the thermal throttling limit set by the battery's thermal zone.

For more information, see the **Thermal zones** section in the [ACPI defined devices](acpi-defined-devices.md#thermal-zones) topic.

## Function 1: Battery thermal limit

The _DSM control method parameters for the battery charging thermal limit function are as follows:

### Arguments

- **Arg0:** UUID = 4c2067e3-887d-475c-9720-4af1d3ed602e

- **Arg1:** Revision = 0

- **Arg2:** Function index = 1

- **Arg3:** Thermal limit (integer value from 0 to 100)

### Return

None. Firmware is responsible for taking the current thermal limit into account when engaging charging.
