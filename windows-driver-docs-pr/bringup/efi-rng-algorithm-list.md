# EFI_RNG_ALGORITHM_LIST structure

This data structure contains a list of the supported Random Number Generation (RNG) algorithms.

## Syntax

```cpp
typedef struct _EFI_RNG_ALGORITHM_LIST {
  UINT32     AlgorithmsCount;
  EFI_GUID * Algorithms;
} EFI_RNG_ALGORITHM_LIST, *PEFI_RNG_ALGORITHM_LIST;
```

## Members

**AlgorithmsCount**  
The number of algorithms in the list.

**Algorithms**  
Pointer to a list of RNG algorithms. Each algorithm is `sizeof(EFI_GUID)` bytes long. It is the caller's responsibility to free this memory by using EFI_BOOT_SERVICES->FreePool().

## Remarks

An implementation may support one or more ways to provide RNG values. The list of supported RNG algorithms is represented in this structure.

The following list provides EFI GUID values for a selection of EFI_RNG_PROTOCOL algorithms. The list is not meant to be exhaustive and may be augmented by vendors or other industry standards.

```cpp
#define EFI_RNG_ALGORITHM_SP800_90_HASH_256_GUID   \
  {0xa7af67cb, 0x603b, 0x4d42, 0xba, 0x21, 0x70, 0xbf, 0xb6, 0x29,\
   0x3f, 0x96}
#define EFI_RNG_ALGORITHM_SP800_90_HMAC_256_GUID    \
  {0xc5149b43, 0xae85, 0x4f53, 0x99, 0x82, 0xb9, 0x43, 0x35, 0xd3,\
   0xa9, 0xe7}
#define EFI_RNG_ALGORITHM_SP800_90_CTR_256_GUID \
  {0x44f0de6e, 0x4d8c, 0x4045, 0xa8, 0xc7, 0x4d, 0xd1, 0x68, 0x85,\
   0x6b, 0x9e}
```
