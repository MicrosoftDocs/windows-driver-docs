# CGMS-A Standards


Multiple standards define the Content Generation Management System Analog (CGMS-A) protection type. Various countries and regions use various versions of CGMS-A. A hardware vendor must ensure that his or her display miniport driver supports the appropriate CGMS-A version. For example, a driver for a graphics adapter to be used in Japan should probably support the Association of Radio Industries and Businesses (ARIB) TR-B15 standard, which is the operational guideline for digital satellite broadcasting. However, a driver for a graphics adapter to be used in the United States should support the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) 61880 standard or the Consumer Electronics Association (CEA) CEA-608-B standard. The standard that a graphics adapter's display miniport driver supports depends on the type of signal that the adapter transmits. The following list describes various standards that define CGMS-A. Currently, redistribution control is defined only in the CEA-805-A standard.

Data on Component Video Interfaces

Defines how CGMS-A and redistribution control information should be encoded in an analog 480p, 720p, or 1080i signal that is transmitted from a component video output (Y/Pb/Pr output).

This standard is published by CEA. For more information about CEA, see the [Consumer Electronics Association](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=71276) website.

Line 21 Data Services

Defines how CGMS-A information should be encoded in a 480i signal that is transmitted from an RF, composite, or S-Video output.

This standard is published by CEA and Electronic Components Industry Association (ECIA). For more information about ECIA, see the [Electronic Components Industry Association](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=71278) website.

Operational Guideline for Digital Satellite Broadcasting

Defines how CGMS-A information should be encoded in an analog 480i, 480p, 720p, or 1080i signal that is transmitted from a video output.

This standard applies only to Japan.

This standard is published by ARIB. For more information about ARIB, see the [ARIB English](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=71283) website.
