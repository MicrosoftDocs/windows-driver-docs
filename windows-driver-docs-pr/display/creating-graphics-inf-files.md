# Creating Graphics INF Files


## <span id="ddk_creating_graphics_inf_files_gg"></span><span id="DDK_CREATING_GRAPHICS_INF_FILES_GG"></span>


NT-based operating system display and video miniport drivers must be installed using an INF file. The Driver Development Kit (DDK) provides a tool called *geninf.exe* that lets you generate an INF file for your display and video miniport drivers.

**Note**   The *geninf.exe* tool is not available in the Windows Driver Kit (WDK), which replaces the DDK.

 

When *geninf.exe* is run, it displays a number of dialogs that prompt you for information, such as the company name and the names of the display drivers and video miniport driver. *Geninf.exe* then generates an INF file from this information.

**Note**   The file generated by *geninf.exe* might not be a fully valid INF file. *Geninf.exe* produces an INF file that will likely need custom registry settings added for each device described in the INF file.

 

If your miniport driver maps more than 8 MB of device memory, you should manually edit the INF file to include the section and appropriate entries described in [INF GeneralConfigData Section](inf-generalconfigdata-section.md).

When you run *geninf.exe*, select "Display" when prompted to choose the device class. An INF file marked as **Class=Display** will be interpreted by the system-supplied display class installer during driver installation. This ensures that all registry entries associated with a video driver are properly initialized.

An INF file of the class **Display** can install only the following files on the system:

-   A single miniport driver

-   A single display driver

-   Control panel extension DLLs

No other types of driver or application files can be installed from an INF file of class **Display**.

You cannot use *geninf.exe* to generate:

-   An INF file that supports more than one architecture.

-   An INF file that supports Windows 95/98/Me or Windows NT version 4.0 or previous.

-   A [*mirror driver*](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff556308#wdkgloss-mirror-driver) INF file. Use the INF file provided with the *mirror* sample driver as a template. See [Mirror Driver INF File](mirror-driver-inf-file.md) for more details.

-   A monitor INF file. Use the INF named *monsamp.inf* as a template. See [Monitor INF File Sections](monitor-inf-file-sections.md) for more details.

These sample INF files are both shipped with the Windows Driver Kit (WDK).

See [Creating an INF File](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff549520) and [INF File Sections and Directives](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff547433) for detailed information when updating a sample INF file.
