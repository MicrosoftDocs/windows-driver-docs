# Reporting Support for 32-bit Indices


## <span id="ddk_reporting_support_for_32_bit_indices_gg"></span><span id="DDK_REPORTING_SUPPORT_FOR_32_BIT_INDICES_GG"></span>


Before DirectX 8.0, vertex indices were restricted to 16-bit quantities. DirectX 8.0 adds support for 32-bit indices. A driver reports support for 32-bit indices by setting the value of the **MaxVertexIndex** field of D3DCAPS8 (currently also in [**D3DHAL\_D3DEXTENDEDCAPS**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dhal/ns-d3dhal-_d3dhal_d3dextendedcaps)) to a value greater than 0xFFFF. This field also allows the driver to report that although it supports indices requiring 32-bits of storage it does not support the full range of 32-bit values.

**DirectX 9.0 and later versions only.**

 

In order for a driver to expose its Direct3D hardware abstraction layer (HAL) device to applications through DirectX 9.0 interfaces, the driver must set the value of **MaxVertexIndex** to a value greater than or equal to 0xFFFF.
