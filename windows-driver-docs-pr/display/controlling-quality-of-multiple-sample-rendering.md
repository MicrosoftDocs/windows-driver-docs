# Controlling Quality of Multiple-Sample Rendering

Before an application can request to create a surface with a specific multisampling technique, it should call the **IDirect3D9::CheckDeviceMultiSampleType** method to verify if the display device supports that technique. The runtime in turn sends a **GetDriverInfo2** request using the **D3DGDI2\_TYPE\_GETMULTISAMPLEQUALITYLEVELS** value to retrieve the number of quality levels for the particular multisample type and surface format associated with the technique. For more information about **GetDriverInfo2**, see [Supporting GetDriverInfo2](supporting-getdriverinfo2.md).

Whether the display device supports maskable multisampling (more than one sample for a multiple-sample render-target format plus antialias support) or just nonmaskable multisampling (only antialias support), the driver for the device must provide the number of quality levels for the D3DMULTISAMPLE\_NONMASKABLE multiple-sample type. Applications that just use multisampling for antialiasing purposes are then only required to query for the number of nonmaskable multiple-sample quality levels that the driver supports.

Besides verifying whether the display device supports the multisampling technique, **IDirect3D9::CheckDeviceMultiSampleType** also returns the number of quality levels associated with the technique.

When the application requests to create a surface, it uses a combination of surface format, multisample type, and number of quality levels whose support was previously verified. This ensures that the surface is created successfully. The runtime calls the driver's [*DdCanCreateSurface*](/previous-versions/windows/hardware/drivers/ff549213(v=vs.85)), [*DdCreateSurface*](/previous-versions/windows/hardware/drivers/ff549263(v=vs.85)), or [**D3dCreateSurfaceEx**](/windows/win32/api/ddrawint/nc-ddrawint-pdd_createsurfaceex) function to create the surface. In this call, the runtime encodes the number of samples for the multiple-sampled surface into five bits (the DDSCAPS3\_MULTISAMPLE\_MASK mask) and the number of multiple-sample quality levels into three bits (the DDSCAPS3\_MULTISAMPLE\_QUALITY\_MASK mask) of the **dwCaps3** member of the [**DDSCAPS2**](/previous-versions/windows/hardware/drivers/ff550292(v=vs.85)) structure for the surface.

For more information about **IDirect3D9::CheckDeviceMultiSampleType**, see the latest DirectX SDK documentation.
