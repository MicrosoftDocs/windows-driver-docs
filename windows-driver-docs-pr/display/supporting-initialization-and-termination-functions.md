# Supporting Initialization and Termination Functions


## <span id="ddk_supporting_initialization_and_termination_functions_gg"></span><span id="DDK_SUPPORTING_INITIALIZATION_AND_TERMINATION_FUNCTIONS_GG"></span>


A graphics driver can support multiple devices and multiple concurrent use of each device. Therefore, initialization and termination occur in three distinct layers, with each layer having its own timing. Initialization occurs in the following order:

1.  [Driver initialization](driver-initialization-and-cleanup.md)

2.  [PDEV initialization](pdev-initialization-and-cleanup.md)

3.  [Surface initialization](enabling-and-disabling-the-surface.md)

Termination occurs in the reverse order.
