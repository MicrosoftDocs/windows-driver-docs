# Copying Volume Textures in the DP2 Stream


## <span id="ddk_copying_volume_textures_in_the_dp2_stream_gg"></span><span id="DDK_COPYING_VOLUME_TEXTURES_IN_THE_DP2_STREAM_GG"></span>


A new DP2 token, D3DDP2OP\_VOLUMEBLT, has been added to support optimal copying and updating of volume textures. This token is very similar to the existing D3DDP2OP\_TEXBLT that copies and updates textures but has been extended to support subvolume (box) copying rather than simple rectangles.
