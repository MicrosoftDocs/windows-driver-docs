# Reporting Support of UBYTE4 Vertex Element


## <span id="ddk_reporting_support_of_ubyte4_vertex_element_gg"></span><span id="DDK_REPORTING_SUPPORT_OF_UBYTE4_VERTEX_ELEMENT_GG"></span>


A DirectX 9.0 version driver must report support of the UBYTE4 vertex element type by setting the D3DDTCAPS\_UBYTE4 bit in the **DeclTypes** member of the D3DCAPS9 structure. To indicate nonsupport of the UBYTE4 vertex element type, the driver does not set the D3DDTCAPS\_UBYTE4 bit. In contrast, A DirectX 8.1 and earlier driver sets the D3DVTXPCAPS\_NO\_VSDT\_UBYTE4 bit to indicate nonsupport of the UBYTE4 vertex element type.
