# What's new for Windows 7 display drivers (WDDM 1.1)


The Windows Driver Kit (WDK) that is released with Windows 7 includes new features for user-mode display drivers and kernel-mode display miniport drivers. It also includes updates to the requirements for installing display drivers that are optimized for Windows 7 and information about new Microsoft Win32 APIs that are available in Windows 7 that control desktop display setup.

You can develop your kernel-mode display miniport driver to run on Windows 7 with the following capabilities:

[Connecting and Configuring Displays - DDIs](ccd-ddis.md)

[GDI Hardware Acceleration](gdi-hardware-acceleration.md)

### <span id="new_inf_requirements"></span><span id="NEW_INF_REQUIREMENTS"></span>New INF Requirements

The INF files for display drivers that are written to the Windows Vista display driver model and that are optimized for the model's Windows 7 features, require several updates. For information about these updates, see [Installing Display Drivers Optimized for Windows 7 and Later](installing-display-drivers-optimized-for-windows-7-and-later.md).

### <span id="gpuview"></span><span id="GPUVIEW"></span>GPUView

The release of the Windows 7 operating system also introduces GPUView (GPUView.exe), which is a new development tool that monitors the performance of the graphics processing unit (GPU). For more information about GPUView, see [Using GPUView](using-gpuview.md).
