# Video Miniport Driver's Device Extension (Windows 2000 Model)

A device extension is each miniport driver's primary and only global storage area for adapter-specific state information.

Each miniport driver defines the size, internal structure, and contents of its device extension. The video port driver passes a pointer to the device extension as an input parameter to every system-defined miniport driver function except **DriverEntry** and, if implemented, the [*HwVidSynchronizeExecutionCallback*](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/video/nc-video-pminiport_synchronize_routine) and *SvgaHwIoPortXxx* functions. Many **VideoPort**_Xxx_ functions require this pointer as an argument as well.

The miniport driver must also use the device extension to maintain the state information for a single adapter. Each adapter detected by the system will have separate state information maintained in a separate device extension. The miniport driver must not use global variables to store any per-adapter state. This is especially critical in order to provide seamless multiple monitor support.
