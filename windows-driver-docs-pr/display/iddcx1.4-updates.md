# Updates for IddCx versions 1.4 and later

This section details features introduced in IddCx 1.4, which is supported in Windows 10 version 1903, and provides guidance on how to update an indirect display driver (IDD) for IddCx 1.4.

The majority of IddCx 1.4 updates are to support remote session IDDs. Remote IDDs need to be part of a remote driver package which includes a remote protocol stack driver, which is beyond the scope of this documentation. See [Remote Desktop Protocol Provider API](/windows/win32/termserv/custom-remote-desktop-protocols) for more information.
