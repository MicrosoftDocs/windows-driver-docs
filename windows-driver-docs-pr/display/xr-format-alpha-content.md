# XR Format Alpha Content


This section applies only to Windows 7 and later operating systems.

As you can determine from the format names in the table in the [Details of the Extended Format](details-of-the-extended-format.md) section, the alpha channel is interpreted as a UNORM value that is in the range \[0,1\] and should be treated identically to the alpha channel of the existing format DXGI\_FORMAT\_R10G10B10A2\_UNORM.
