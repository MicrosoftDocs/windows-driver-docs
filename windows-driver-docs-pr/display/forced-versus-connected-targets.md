# Forced Versus Connected Targets


This section applies only to Windows 7 and later, and Windows Server 2008 R2 and later versions of Windows operating system.

The CCD APIs introduce the concepts of connected monitors and forceable targets. A monitor is connected to a target if the GPU can detect the presence of the monitor, which is a physical attribute of the monitor and target. A target is forceable if the GPU can send a display signal out of the target even if the GPU cannot detect a connected monitor. All analog target types are considered forceable, and all digital targets are not considered forceable. The following table describes the combination of connected and forced states when the path is active and not active.

The following table describes several types of possible forced state for each path.

<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="left"><p>Normal force</p></td>

<tr class="even">

<td align="left"><p>This forced state is lost after reboot. The Microsoft Win32 <strong>ChangeDisplaySettingsEx</strong> function always destroys all path-persisted monitors even if those monitors in their paths are the target of the <strong>ChangeDisplaySettingsEx</strong> call. If a caller calls the <a href="/windows/win32/api/winuser/nf-winuser-setdisplayconfig" data-raw-source="[&lt;strong&gt;SetDisplayConfig&lt;/strong&gt;](/windows/win32/api/winuser/nf-winuser-setdisplayconfig)"><strong>SetDisplayConfig</strong></a> CCD function with the SDC_USE_SUPPLIED_DISPLAY_CONFIG or SDC_TOPOLOGY_SUPPLIED flag set in the <em>Flags</em> parameter, <strong>SetDisplayConfig</strong> removes the path-persisted monitor if the new topology does not include the path that the monitor is in. For all other SDC_TOPOLOGY_XXX flags that the caller specifies in the <em>Flags</em> parameter, <strong>SetDisplayConfig</strong> removes the path-persisted monitor unless the caller also specifies the SDC_PATH_PERSIST_IF_REQUIRED flag and the path is active in the new topology.</p></td>
