# Using the Graphics DDI

In response to device-independent application calls routed through the Graphics Device Interface (GDI), a graphics driver must ensure that its graphics device produces the required output. A graphics driver controls graphics output by implementing as much of the graphics Device Driver Interface (DDI) as is necessary.

Graphics DDI function names are in the *DrvXxx* form. GDI calls these *DrvXxx* functions to pass data to the driver. When an application makes a request of GDI, and GDI determines that the driver supports the relevant function, GDI calls that function. It is the responsibility of the driver to provide the function and return to GDI upon the function's completion.

This section describes the graphics DDI functions that writers of display and printer drivers must be aware of. Graphics DDI function declarations, structure definitions, and constants can be found in *winddi.h*.
