# XDDM overview

The Windows 2000 Display Driver Model (XDDM) is the legacy display/graphics driver architecture that was used for Windows 2000 through Windows Vista and Windows 7.

> [!NOTE]
>
> The XDDM design guide is preserved for historical purposes only. Current driver developers should use the [Windows Display Driver Model (WDDM)](windows-vista-display-driver-model-design-guide.md).

Display adapter drivers that run on Windows Vista can adhere to the WDDM or XDDM.

XDDM and VGA drivers will not compile or run on Windows 8 and later versions. If display hardware is attached to a Windows 8 computer without a driver that is certified to support WDDM 1.2 or later, the system defaults to running the [Microsoft Basic Display Driver](microsoft-basic-display-driver.md).
