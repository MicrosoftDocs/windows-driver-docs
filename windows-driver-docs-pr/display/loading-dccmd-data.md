The DCCMD (display control command) data is formatted in a manner compatible with the DVD ROM specification, and is to be applied along with highlight data to a DPXD surface to create an alpha-blending surface. The DCCMD data buffer contents must consist of data formatted as a list of DVD DCCMDs. For further clarification of DVD subpicture definition and data field interpretation, see *DVD Specifications for Read-Only Disk: Part 3 - Video Specification (version 1.11, May 1999)*.
