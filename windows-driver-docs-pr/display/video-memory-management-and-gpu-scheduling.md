# Video Memory Management and GPU Scheduling


## <span id="ddk_video_memory_management_and_gpu_scheduling_gg"></span><span id="DDK_VIDEO_MEMORY_MANAGEMENT_AND_GPU_SCHEDULING_GG"></span>

The video memory manager is currently implemented in the following OS files: 

* dxgkrnl.sys
* dxgmms1.sys
* dxgmms2.sys

These files are only available as part of an OS install, and are not available as a separate download. These files are only designed to work together with the other OS files that accompany them. Mismatching versions between these files are not supported by Microsoft, and routinely do not work.

The following sections describe the video memory management and graphics processing unit (GPU) scheduling model:

[Handling Memory Segments](handling-memory-segments.md)

[Handling Command and DMA Buffers](handling-command-and-dma-buffers.md)

[GDI Hardware Acceleration](gdi-hardware-acceleration.md)

[Video memory offer and reclaim](video-memory-offer-and-reclaim.md)

[GPU preemption](gpu-preemption.md)
