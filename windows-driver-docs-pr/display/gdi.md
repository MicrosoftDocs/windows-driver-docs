# GDI

The topics in this section describe the Graphics Device Interface (GDI) and its relationship to printer drivers and display adapter drivers.

> WDDM drivers do not directly use the services of the GDI engine; therefore, the topics in this section are not relevant to writing display drivers for the WDDM driver model.
