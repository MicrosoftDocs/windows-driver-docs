# Performing Floating-point Operations in Direct3D

The DirectX runtime saves and restores floating-point state when it calls many of a display driver's Direct3D callback functions. However, as described in [Performing Floating-point Operations in DirectDraw](performing-floating-point-operations-in-directdraw.md), some of the driver's Direct3D callback functions must save floating-point state prior to performing floating-point operations and must restore floating-point state when the operations complete.

The DirectX runtime saves and restores floating-point state as required for the following Direct3D callback functions:

* [**D3dContextCreate**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dhal/nc-d3dhal-lpd3dhal_contextcreatecb)

* [**D3dContextDestroy**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dhal/nc-d3dhal-lpd3dhal_contextdestroycb)

* [**D3dDrawPrimitives2**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dhal/nc-d3dhal-lpd3dhal_drawprimitives2cb)

* [**D3dGetDriverState**](/windows/win32/api/ddrawint/nc-ddrawint-pdd_getdriverstate)

* [**D3dValidateTextureStageState**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dhal/nc-d3dhal-lpd3dhal_validatetexturestagestatecb)

For the following callback functions, a Direct3D-supported display driver must save floating-point state before performing floating-point operations, and restore it when the operations are complete:

* [**D3dCreateSurfaceEx**](/windows/win32/api/ddrawint/nc-ddrawint-pdd_createsurfaceex)

* [**D3dDestroyDDLocal**](/windows/win32/api/ddrawint/nc-ddrawint-pdd_destroyddlocal)

* [D3DBuffer Callbacks](/windows/win32/api/ddrawint/ns-ddrawint-dd_d3dbufcallbacks)
