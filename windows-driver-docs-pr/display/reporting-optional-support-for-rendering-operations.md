Beginning with Windows 7, a display miniport driver can set additional members in the [**DXGK\_PRESENTATIONCAPS**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff562004) structure to indicate certain rendering operations that the driver can or cannot support.

For further information about available rendering capability settings, see [**DXGK\_PRESENTATIONCAPS**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff562004).
