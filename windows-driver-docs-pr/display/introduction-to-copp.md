# Introduction to COPP


## <span id="ddk_introduction_to_the_certified_output_protection_protocol_gg"></span><span id="DDK_INTRODUCTION_TO_THE_CERTIFIED_OUTPUT_PROTECTION_PROTOCOL_GG"></span>


**This section applies only to Windows Server 2003 with SP1 and later, and Windows XP with SP2 and later.**

COPP provides a mechanism of applying copy protection to video that is output by the graphics adapter. COPP provides a common protocol for sending various link-protection requirements to the graphics adapter in a more protected fashion than by using the [**IOCTL\_VIDEO\_HANDLE\_VIDEOPARAMETERS**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ntddvdeo/ni-ntddvdeo-ioctl_video_handle_videoparameters) I/O control (IOCTL) code.

The following topics describe COPP:
