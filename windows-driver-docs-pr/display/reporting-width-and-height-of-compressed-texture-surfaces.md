# Reporting Width and Height of Compressed Texture Surfaces


## <span id="ddk_reporting_width_and_height_of_compressed_texture_surfaces_gg"></span><span id="DDK_REPORTING_WIDTH_AND_HEIGHT_OF_COMPRESSED_TEXTURE_SURFACES_GG"></span>


When the DirectX runtime requests that a driver create a DXT*n* compressed texture surface whose width and height are less than 4x4, the driver actually allocates a 4x4 block of memory for the texture surface. However, the driver reports the width and height of the texture surface as the values that the runtime requested. For example, if a 2x2 DXT1 compressed texture surface is requested, the driver allocates a 4x4 block but reports that the block is 2x2 by leaving the requested texture size unchanged. To request a specific DXT*n* compressed texture size, the runtime sets the **dwWidth** and **dwHeight** members of a [**DDSURFACEDESC**](/previous-versions/windows/hardware/drivers/ff550339(v=vs.85)) or [**DDSURFACEDESC2**](/previous-versions/windows/hardware/drivers/ff550340(v=vs.85)) structure that represents the texture surface. The driver does not alter these size settings even if it allocates a 4x4 texture surface when the request is for a texture surface whose width and height are less than 4x4.
