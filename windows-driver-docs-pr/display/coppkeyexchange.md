# COPPKeyExchange function

The sample COPPKeyExchange function retrieves the digital certificate used by the graphics hardware.

### Syntax

```cpp
HRESULT COPPKeyExchange(
  _In_  COPP_DeviceData pThis,
  _Out_ GUID            *pRandom,
  _Out_ BYTE            *pGHCertificate
);
```

## Parameters

*pThis [in]*

* Pointer to the COPP DirectX VA device object.

*pRandom [out]*

* Pointer to a variable that receives a 128-bit random number.

*pGHCertificate [out]*

* Pointer to a list of bytes that receives the graphics hardware certificate.

## Return value

Returns zero (S_OK or DD_OK) if successful; otherwise, returns an error code.

## Remarks

A COPP DirectX VA device should provide the size of the graphics hardware certificate to the VMR before receiving a call to its COPPKeyExchange function. That is, the COPPGetCertificateLength function should be called before COPPKeyExchange. If COPPKeyExchange is called before COPPGetCertificateLength, COPPKeyExchange should return E_UNEXPECTED.

## Mapping RenderMoComp to COPPKeyExchange

The sample COPPKeyExchange function maps directly to a call to the RenderMoComp member of the DD_MOTIONCOMPCALLBACKS structure. The RenderMoComp member points to the display driver-supplied DdMoCompRender callback function that references the DD_RENDERMOCOMPDATA structure.

The RenderMoComp callback function is called without the display driver-supplied BeginMoCompFrame or EndMoCompFrame function being called first.

The DD_RENDERMOCOMPDATA structure is filled as follows.

| Member | Value |
|--|--|
| dwNumBuffers | Number of buffers at lpBufferInfo. The value is 1. |
| lpBufferInfo | Pointer to a single RGB32 system memory surface that contains the space required to hold the hardware certificate. The required length of the surface was returned in the call to COPPGetCertificateLength. <br>Note that a system memory surface is used to return the certificate because the size of the certificate can exceed the size of the maximum buffer passed via the lpOutputData parameter.|
| dwFunction | DXVA_COPPKeyExchangeFnCode constant (defined in dxva.h). |
| lpInputData | NULL. |
| lpOutputData | Pointer to a 128-bit random number generated by the driver. |

## Example Code

The following code provides an example of how you can implement your COPPKeyExchange function:

```cpp
DWORD
COPP_Generate128BitRandomNumber()
{
    GUID RandNum;
    DWORD* pdw = (DWORD*)&RandNum;
    pdw[0] = rand();
    pdw[1] = rand();
    pdw[2] = rand();
    pdw[3] = rand();
    return RandNum;
}

HRESULT
COPPKeyExchange(
    COPP_DeviceData* pThis,
    GUID* pRandNumber,
    BYTE* pGHCertificate
    )
{
    if (pThis->m_COPPDevState != COPP_CERT_LENGTH_RETURNED) {
        return E_UNEXPECTED;
    }
    memcpy(pGHCertificate, (LPVOID)&TestCert, sizeof(TestCert));
    pThis->m_rGraphicsDriver = *pRandNumber = COPP_Generate128BitRandomNumber();
    pThis->m_COPPDevState = COPP_KEY_EXCHANGED;
    return NO_ERROR;
}
```
