# Installation Requirements for Display Drivers Optimized for Windows 7 and Later


This section applies only to Windows 7 and later, and Windows Server 2008 R2 and later versions of Windows operating system.

Any INF files for display drivers that are written to the Windows Display Driver Model (WDDM), and that are optimized for Windows 7 and later, must conform to several requirements that are described in [Installation Requirements for Display Miniport and User-Mode Display Drivers](installing-display-miniport-and-user-mode-display-drivers.md). The most notable change is in the **FeatureScore** directive.

The following requirements are new for display driver INF files starting with Windows 7:

[Setting the Feature Score for Windows 7 Display Drivers](setting-the-feature-score-for-windows-7-display-drivers.md)

[Appending Information to the Friendly String Names for Windows 7 Display Drivers](appending-information-to-the-friendly-string-names-for-windows-7-displ.md)

[Differentiating the SKU for Windows 7 Display Drivers](differentiating-the-sku-for-windows-7-display-drivers.md)

[Encoding Windows 7 Display Driver INF Files in Unicode](encoding-windows-7-display-driver-inf-files-in-unicode.md)
