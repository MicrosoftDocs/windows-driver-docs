# GDI Service Routines


## <span id="ddk_gdi_service_routines_gg"></span><span id="DDK_GDI_SERVICE_ROUTINES_GG"></span>


GDI exports many service routines, whose names have the form **Eng***Xxx*. The driver dynamically links to *win32k.sys* to directly access these routines. GDI service routines include surface management, rendering simulations, and path, palette, font, and text services. These services are discussed in detail in [GDI Support Services](gdi-support-services.md).
