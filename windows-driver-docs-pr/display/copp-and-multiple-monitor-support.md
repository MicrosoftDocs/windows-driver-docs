# COPP and Multiple-Monitor Support


## <span id="ddk_copp_and_multiple_monitor_support_gg"></span><span id="DDK_COPP_AND_MULTIPLE_MONITOR_SUPPORT_GG"></span>


This section applies only to Windows Server 2003 SP1 and later, and Windows XP SP2 and later.

The only multiple-monitor mode supported by COPP is DualView. Various clone and theater modes are not supported. The only exception to this rule is the case where a graphics adapter uses both composite and S-Video connectors and simultaneously feeds the same display signal through both connectors. In this case, the video miniport driver should report that the connector is S-Video and should ensure that the appropriate protections are applied to both display outputs when requested by COPP calls initiated through applications.
