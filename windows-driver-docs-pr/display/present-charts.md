# Present Charts

The Present Charts are process-specific. They are shown below the Context CPU Queue and above the threads. As can be seen in the following diagram, the Present Charts are broken into a Frames Per Second (FPS) and Latency chart.

:::image type="content" source="images/present-charts.png" alt-text="Diagram that shows Present Charts with FPS and Latency sections.":::

The Frames Per Second Chart shows the frame rate. The key for the frame rate is red.

The Latency Chart shows the time between a frame being ready to show and when it is shown. The key is red and higher latencies indicate that there is lower throughput.
