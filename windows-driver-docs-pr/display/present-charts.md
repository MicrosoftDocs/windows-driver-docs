# Present Charts

The Present Charts are process-specific. They are shown below the Context CPU Queue and above the threads. As can be seen in the following diagram, the Present Charts are broken into a Frames Per Second (FPS) and Latency chart.

The Frames Per Second Chart shows the frame rate. The key for the frame rate is red. 

The Latency Chart shows the time between a frame being ready to show and when it is shown. The key is red and higher latencies indicate that there is lower throughput.
