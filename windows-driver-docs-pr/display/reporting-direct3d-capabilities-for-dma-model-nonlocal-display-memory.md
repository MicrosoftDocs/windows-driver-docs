# Reporting Direct3D Capabilities for Nonlocal Display Memory

A DMA model driver must also export the Direct3D capabilities for nonlocal display memory surfaces. This is significantly simpler than reporting DirectDraw capabilities. The only capability affected is D3DDEVCAPS\_TEXTURENONLOCALVIDEOMEMORY. If a display card exporting the DMA model can texture directly from nonlocal display memory, it should set this capability in its Direct3D device description. If it cannot, and the application must explicitly load or blt the nonlocal display memory surface to a local display memory surface before performing texturing, it should not set this capability. For completeness, an execute model driver should always set this capability bit.
