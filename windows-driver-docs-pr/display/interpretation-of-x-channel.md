# Interpretation of X Channel


This section applies only to Windows 7 and later operating systems.

The user-mode display driver should read the X channel in all formats that include X (for example, DXGI\_FORMAT\_B8G8R8X8\_UNORM) as 1.0f when such formats are presented to filtering hardware or the blender.

The X channel must be copied unmodified when data is moved outside of the 3-D pipeline (that is, when an application calls the **ID3D10Device::CopyResource**, **ID3D10Device::CopySubresourceRegion**, or **ID3D10Device::UpdateSubResource** method). For more information about these methods, see the DirectX SDK documentation.
