# Charts in the Main Window

GPUView provides a number of different charts that show information gathered from specific events in a graphical manner. Each chart can be toggled on and off via the Charts menu. 

All charts have some basic functionality. The left-hand side has the name, color key, and scale, whereas the right-hand side that corresponds to the viewport time has the graphed data. The scope of the chart can be global or process-specific. If it is global, the chart is displayed in the nonscrollable Hardware Queue area. If the scope is process-specific, the chart will be displayed in the process area. 

This section provides details about the different types of charts:
