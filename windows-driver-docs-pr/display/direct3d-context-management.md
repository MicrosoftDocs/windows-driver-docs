# Direct3D Context Management


## <span id="ddk_direct3d_context_management_gg"></span><span id="DDK_DIRECT3D_CONTEXT_MANAGEMENT_GG"></span>


A context encapsulates the state information for an application-created Microsoft Direct3D hardware abstraction layer (HAL) device; that is, a context describes how the driver should draw. State includes information such as the surface being rendered to, the depth surface, shading information, and texture information.

A Direct3D driver is responsible for creating and managing its own rendering contexts.
