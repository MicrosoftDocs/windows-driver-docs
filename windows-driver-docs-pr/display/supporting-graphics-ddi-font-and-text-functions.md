# Supporting Graphics DDI Font and Text Functions

For many devices, GDI can handle all font functions. Some drivers, however, can draw their own fonts, or their device's own fonts, on device surfaces. Other drivers are font drivers, which can provide glyph bitmaps and/or outlines, as well as glyph metrics to GDI. In these cases, the driver must support some of the available font functions.

Text output is a more general function. If the surface is a standard-format bitmap, GDI can handle all text output, unless the driver hooks out the call to enhance performance. For a device-managed surface, the driver must support text output.

The following topics provide information with regard to the support of font and text management functions.
