# Controlling Multisampling


## <span id="ddk_controlling_multisampling_gg"></span><span id="DDK_CONTROLLING_MULTISAMPLING_GG"></span>


Two render states of the D3DRENDERSTATETYPE enumeration control multisample rendering. For more information about D3DRENDERSTATETYPE, see the DirectX 8.0 SDK documentation.

### <span id="d3drs_multisampleantialias"></span><span id="D3DRS_MULTISAMPLEANTIALIAS"></span>D3DRS\_MULTISAMPLEANTIALIAS

A BOOL value that determines how individual samples are computed when using a multisample render target buffer. When set to **TRUE**, the multiple samples are computed so that full-scene anti-aliasing is performed by sampling at different sample positions for each multiple sample. When set to **FALSE**, the multiple samples are all written with the same sample value (sampled at the pixel center), which allows nonantialiased rendering to a multisample buffer. This render state has no effect when rendering to a single sample buffer. The default value is **TRUE**.

### <span id="d3drs_multisamplemask"></span><span id="D3DRS_MULTISAMPLEMASK"></span>D3DRS\_MULTISAMPLEMASK

Each bit in this mask, starting at the LSB, controls modification of one of the samples in a multisample render target. Thus, for an 8-sample render target, the low byte contains the 8 write enables for each of the 8 samples. This render state has no effect when rendering to a single sample buffer. The default value is 0xFFFFFFFF.

This render state enables use of a multisample buffer as an accumulation buffer, doing multipass rendering of geometry where each pass updates a subset of samples.

Each sample in a multisample render target contributes uniform intensity to the final presented image. Consider, for example, that the multisample mode is 3 and the number of samples that are enabled using multisample masking is 2. Therefore, the resulting intensity of the rendered image is 2/3. That is, the intensity of each red, green, and blue component of every pixel is factored by 2/3.
