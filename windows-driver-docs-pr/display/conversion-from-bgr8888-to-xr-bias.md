# Conversion from BGR8888 to XR\_BIAS


This section applies only to Windows 7 and later operating systems.

The conversion from BGR8888-type formats (for example, DXGI\_FORMAT\_B8G8R8A8\_UNORM) to XR\_BIAS is lossless.

The scale factor of 510 is explicitly chosen to provide a cleanly invertible conversion between a BGR8888-type format and XR\_BIAS without causing the nonlinear jump near 0.5 that would be implied by a scale factor of 511.
