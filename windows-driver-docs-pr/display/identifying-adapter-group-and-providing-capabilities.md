# Identifying Adapter Group and Providing Capabilities


## <span id="ddk_identifying_adapter_group_and_providing_capabilities_gg"></span><span id="DDK_IDENTIFYING_ADAPTER_GROUP_AND_PROVIDING_CAPABILITIES_GG"></span>


The DirectX 9.0 runtime sends a **GetDriverInfo2** request using the D3DGDI2\_TYPE\_GETADAPTERGROUP value to a DirectX 9.0 version driver to request the identifier for the group of adapters that make up the driver's multiple-head video card. The driver returns the identifier in the **ulUniqueAdapterGroupId** member of a [**DD\_GETADAPTERGROUPDATA**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dhal/ns-d3dhal-_dd_getadaptergroupdata) structure. The driver must provide a unique identifier for the master and all subordinate adapters within a group. The runtime uses this identifier in subsequent operations to determine whether the given adapter is part of a group. This identifier must be unique across drivers, including drivers from other hardware vendors. Therefore, it is recommended to report this identifier as a unique nonzero kernel-mode address that cannot be common with other multiple-head video cards.

A DirectX 9.0 version driver indicates how its multiple-head hardware is configured by setting the following members of the D3DCAPS9 structure:

-   **NumberOfAdaptersInGroup**

    Specifies the number of adapters in the adapter group (only if master). This is 1 for single-head cards (conventional adapters). The value is greater than 1 for the master adapter of a multiple-head card. The value is 0 for a subordinate adapter of a multiple-head card. Each card can have at most one master, but can have many subordinates.

-   **MasterAdapterOrdinal**

    Specifies the number for the master adapter in the group. This number is relevant if the system contains more than one multiple-head card. For example, if the system contains a single-head card, a double-head card, and a triple-head card, the system references the heads as: 0 for the single, 1 and 2 for the double, and 3, 4, and 5 for the triple. In this case, the master adapter is: 0 for the single, 1 for the double, and 3 for the triple.

-   **AdapterOrdinalInGroup**

    Specifies a number that indicates the order in which heads in a group are referenced by the driver. This value is always 0 for the master adapter and numbered consecutively for each subordinate adapter (that is, 1, 2, and so on).

The driver returns a D3DCAPS9 structure in response to a **GetDriverInfo2** query similarly to how it returns a D3DCAPS8 structure as described in [Reporting DirectX 8.0 Style Direct3D Capabilities](reporting-directx-8-0-style-direct3d-capabilities.md). Support of this query is described in [Supporting GetDriverInfo2](supporting-getdriverinfo2.md).
