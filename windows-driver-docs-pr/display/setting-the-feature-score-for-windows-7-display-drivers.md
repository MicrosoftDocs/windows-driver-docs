# Setting the Feature Score for Windows 7 Display Drivers


This section applies only to Windows 7 and later, and Windows Server 2008 R2 and later versions of Windows operating system.

The **FeatureScore** directive is required for all drivers that install and run on Windows Vista and later operating systems. The feature score settings that apply for Windows Vista are described in [Setting the Driver Feature Score](setting-the-driver-feature-score.md). The following table shows the feature score settings that apply for Windows 7 and later.

For drivers written to WDDM, graphics hardware vendors must place the **FeatureScore** directive under the [**DDInstall section**](../install/inf-ddinstall-section.md) of their INF file and use **FeatureScore** to apply the feature score to the drivers.

For [Windows 2000 Display Driver Model](windows-2000-display-driver-model-design-guide.md) drivers, Microsoft applies the appropriate feature score through the class installer at the time of driver installation, or in the INF for in-box Windows 2000 Display Driver Model drivers. Vendors must not use the **FeatureScore** directive to insert a feature score for drivers written to the Windows 2000 Display Driver Model.

An unsigned driver receives a feature score that is equal to FF. This value is the default and indicates no score.
