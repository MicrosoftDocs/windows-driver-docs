# Returning Error Codes Received from Runtime Functions

Calls to the Direct3D version 9 user-mode display driver-supplied functions must return error codes that they receive when they call the [Direct3D runtime-supplied kernel-services accessing functions](direct3d-runtime-functions-called-by-user-mode.md). For example, the runtime might call a user-mode display driver function, such as the [**CreateResource**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dumddi/nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi_createresource) function. This, in turn, calls a runtime-supplied function, such as the [**pfnAllocateCb**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dumddi/nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi_allocatecb) function, to perform a specific operation, in this case to allocate memory for the resource. If the user-mode display driver receives an error code from the call to the runtime-supplied function, it must return that error code back to the runtime.

There is one exception to the rule that a driver must pass a runtime error code back to the runtime. When the driver calls the [**pfnAllocateCb**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dumddi/nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi_allocatecb) runtime-supplied function, to allocate video memory for optional resources when the video memory is already allocated, the rule does not apply. If **pfnAllocateCb** fails to allocate this video memory for optional resources that are only required to optimize performance, the driver should not report the out-of-memory error (E_OUTOFMEMORY) back to the runtime.
