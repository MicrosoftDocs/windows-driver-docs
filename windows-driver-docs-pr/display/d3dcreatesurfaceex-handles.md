# D3dCreateSurfaceEx Handles

Certain situations can cause [**D3dCreateSurfaceEx**](/windows/win32/api/ddrawint/nc-ddrawint-pdd_createsurfaceex) to be called for an invalid, destroyed surface. Drivers can robustly handle this case by simply ignoring any **D3dCreateSurfaceEx** call for a video memory surface that has an **fpVidMem** (a member of the [**DD\_SURFACE\_GLOBAL**](/windows/win32/api/ddrawint/ns-ddrawint-dd_surface_global) structure) of zero. However, a driver can get a **D3dCreateSurfaceEx** call with a system memory surface that has an **fpVidMem** value of zero, which means that the system memory surface is in the process of being destroyed. The driver should then free any existing driver-side data related to this surface.
