# General install section directives


This is a general reminder that all references to out-of-box or production/retail binaries, services, regadd, or delreg sections that are normally part of a retail WHQL driver packages, are not listed in the Windows in-box driver packages.

Do not refer to anything that is required by your OpenGL ICDs, OpenCL, Control Panel, Help files, out-of-box services, polling applications, and so on.
