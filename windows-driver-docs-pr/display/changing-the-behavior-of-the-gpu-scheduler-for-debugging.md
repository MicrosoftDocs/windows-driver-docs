# Changing the Behavior of the GPU Scheduler for Debugging


To help in debugging the driver, the behavior of the graphics processing unit (GPU) scheduler can be changed by configuring the registry.

You can enable or disable preemption requests from the GPU scheduler (see [Timeout Detection and Recovery](timeout-detection-and-recovery.md)) by using the following registry configuration:

```registry
KeyPath   : HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\GraphicsDrivers\Scheduler
KeyValue  : EnablePreemption
ValueType : REG_DWORD
ValueData : 0 to disable preemption, 1 to enable preemption (default).
```
