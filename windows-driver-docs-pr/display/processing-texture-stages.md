# Processing Texture Stages


## <span id="ddk_processing_texture_stages_gg"></span><span id="DDK_PROCESSING_TEXTURE_STAGES_GG"></span>


The driver uses the D3DDP2OP\_TEXTURESTAGESTATE operation code and [**D3DHAL\_DP2TEXTURESTAGESTATE**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dhal/ns-d3dhal-_d3dhal_dp2texturestagestate) structures that follow in the command stream to process changes to texture-stage states. For information about how the driver processes operation codes, see [Command Stream](command-stream.md).

For example, when the operation code is D3DDP2OP\_TEXTURESTAGESTATE, and the value of the **wStateCount** member of the [**D3DHAL\_DP2COMMAND**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dhal/ns-d3dhal-_d3dhal_dp2command) structure is seven, then seven D3DHAL\_DP2TEXTURESTAGESTATE structures follow before the next D3DHAL\_DP2COMMAND instruction is reached. Each D3DHAL\_DP2TEXTURESTAGESTATE structure contains a **dwStage** member that specifies which stage of the texture blending pipeline needs to have a texture state change. The **TSState** member of the same structure specifies which state of the D3DTEXTURESTAGESTATETYPE enumerated type to set, and the **dwValue** member of the D3DHAL\_DP2TEXTURESTAGESTATE structure contains the value to which the specified state should be set.

The process is the same for all render states, or any other type of instruction. If the **bCommand** member of the [**D3DHAL\_DP2COMMAND**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dhal/ns-d3dhal-_d3dhal_dp2command) structure is D3DDP2OP\_RENDERSTATE, then the structure to follow is a [**D3DHAL\_DP2RENDERSTATE**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dhal/ns-d3dhal-_d3dhal_dp2renderstate) structure and the information in that structure is used to set the render state accordingly.

Rather than using distinct Boolean-valued render states to control the coordinates, each render state value is a set of flags composed with the D3DWRAP\_U and D3DWRAP\_V flags (defined in *d3dtypes.h*). This change was made for compatibility with higher-dimensional textures.

Other useful information pertaining to multiple texture implementation can be found in the DirectX SDK documentation, in the sections covering blend equations, semantics of per-texture states, color operations, and alpha operations. For more information about the texture stage state types enabled for DirectX 6.0 and later versions, see the D3DTEXTUREOP and D3DTEXTUREFILTERTYPE enumerated types.

**Note**   DirectX 9.0 and later applications can use values in the D3DSAMPLERSTATETYPE enumeration to control the characteristics of sampler texture-related render states. In DirectX 8.0 and earlier, these sampler states were included in the D3DTEXTURESTAGESTATETYPE enumeration. The runtime maps user-mode sampler states (D3DSAMP\_*Xxx*) to kernel-mode D3DTSS\_*Xxx* values so that drivers are not required to process user-mode sampler states. For more information about D3DSAMPLERSTATETYPE, see the latest DirectX SDK documentation.
