# DD\_DXAPI\_REGISTER\_CALLBACK control code

A video capture driver passes DD\_DXAPI\_REGISTER\_CALLBACK in the *dwFunctionNum* parameter of the [**DxApi**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/dxapi/nf-dxapi-dxapi) function to register a callback that is called when an event occurs.

## Input Parameters

- *lpvInBuffer*  
    Pointer to a [**DDREGISTERCALLBACK**](/windows/win32/api/ddkmapi/ns-ddkmapi-ddregistercallback) structure that contains the information required to register a callback.

## Output Parameters

- *lpvOutBuffer*  
    Pointer to a DWORD that contains the DirectDraw return value.

## Remarks

This function identifier can only register a single event at a time. If the client wants to be called for multiple events, it must call DD\_DXAPI\_REGISTER\_CALLBACK multiple times.

The IRQ events are actually called at IRQ time, so the callback function must return quickly and only perform calls that are safe.

The **pContext** member of DDREGISTERCALLBACK contains client data that is passed back to the client when the [*pfnDirectDrawClose*](/windows/win32/api/ddkmapi/ns-ddkmapi-ddopendirectdrawin#members) callback is called.

This function identifier can only be called from PASSIVE\_LEVEL.
