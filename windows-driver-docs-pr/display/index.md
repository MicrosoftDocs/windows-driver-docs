# Developer documentation for display, graphics, and compute accelerator drivers

Developers create graphics and display drivers by using the [Windows Display Driver Model (WDDM)](windows-vista-display-driver-model-design-guide.md).

Compute accelerator drivers use the [Microsoft Compute Driver Model](mcdm.md) (MCDM), which is a subset of WDDM 2.0+.

For information about available driver samples, see [Windows driver samples](../samples/index.md).

The legacy [Windows 2000 Display Driver Model (XDDM)](/previous-versions/windows/drivers/display/windows-2000-display-driver-model-design-guide) was the display and graphics driver architecture available for Windows 2000 through Windows Vista and Windows 7 only.
