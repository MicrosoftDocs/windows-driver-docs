# Creating the Compressed Texture Surface

Whenever DirectDraw requests the driver to create a surface, the driver must determine whether it is being asked to create a compressed texture surface. To determine this, the driver must check for information that has previously been set by DirectDraw in the [**DDSURFACEDESC2**](/previous-versions/windows/hardware/drivers/ff550340(v=vs.85)) structure for the surface being created. Your driver must include the following verification steps (as with any surface):

-   Check for the DDSCAPS\_TEXTURE flag in the **dwFlags** member of the [**DDSCAPS**](/previous-versions/windows/hardware/drivers/ff550286(v=vs.85)) structure.

-   Check for the DDPF\_FOURCC flag in the **dwFlags** member of the [**DDPIXELFORMAT**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ksmedia/ns-ksmedia-_ddpixelformat) structure for the surface being created. This check should occur before the following **dwFourCC** check.

-   Check for one of the DXT codes in the **dwFourCC** member of the [**DDPIXELFORMAT**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ksmedia/ns-ksmedia-_ddpixelformat) structure for the surface being created.

-   Check the width and height members (**dwWidth** and **dwHeight**) of the [**DDSURFACEDESC2**](/previous-versions/windows/hardware/drivers/ff550340(v=vs.85)) structure. DirectDraw sets these members to multiples of 4 pixels.
