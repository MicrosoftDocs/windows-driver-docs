DirectX 8.0 introduces support for point sprites. A point sprite is an extension to basic point rendering that allows the size of the point to be specified, either by a render state or by a vertex component. When accelerated, the point sprites are rendered in hardware as a screen space quadrilateral formed of two triangles, and render states such as textures and blending are used.
