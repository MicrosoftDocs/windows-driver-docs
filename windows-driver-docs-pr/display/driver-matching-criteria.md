# Driver matching criteria

This topic describes the elements that are used to choose the best driver match for a device on Windows 8 (WDDM 1.2). Graphics/display drivers follow standard Plug and Play (PnP) algorithms. For more up-to-date information, see [How Windows ranks driver packages](../install/how-setup-ranks-drivers--windows-vista-and-later-.md).
