# Child Devices of the Display Adapter


A child device of the display adapter is a device on the display adapter that is enumerated as a child by the display miniport driver. All child devices of the display adapter are on-board; monitors and other external devices that connect to the display adapter are not considered child devices.

The display miniport driver's [**DxgkDdiQueryChildRelations**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/dispmprt/nc-dispmprt-dxgkddi_query_child_relations) function is responsible for enumerating child devices of the display adapter. During the enumeration, the display miniport driver assigns each child device a type and a hot-plug detection (HPD) awareness value. The type is one of the [**DXGK\_CHILD\_DEVICE\_TYPE**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/dispmprt/ne-dispmprt-_dxgk_child_device_type) enumerators:

-   **TypeVideoOutput**

-   **TypeOther**

The HPD awareness value is one of the [**DXGK\_CHILD\_DEVICE\_HPD\_AWARENESS**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dkmdt/ne-d3dkmdt-_dxgk_child_device_hpd_awareness) enumerators:

-   **HpdAwarenessAlwaysConnected**

-   **HpdAwarenessInterruptible**

-   **HpdAwarenessPolled**

The following table gives some examples of devices that have various types and HPD awareness values.

The operating system uses one of several strategies, depending on the HPD awareness value, to determine whether an external device is connected to a child device. The following table briefly describes how the operating system determines the connection status of devices with various HPD awareness values.
