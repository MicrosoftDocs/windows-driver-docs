This section applies only to Windows Server 2003 with SP1 and later, and Windows XP with SP2 and later.

This section provides reference pages for sample Certified Output Protection Protocol (COPP) I/O control (IOCTL) requests that are handled by the video miniport driver. Your driver can either reuse these COPP IOCTLs or create news ones, as appropriate.
