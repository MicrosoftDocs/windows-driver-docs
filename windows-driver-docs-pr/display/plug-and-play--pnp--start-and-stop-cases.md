# Plug and Play (PnP) in WDDM 1.2 and later


All Windows Display Driver Model (WDDM) 1.2 and later display miniport drivers must support the following behavior in response to start and stop requests by the Plug and Play (PnP) infrastructure. Behavior can differ depending on whether the driver returns a success or failure code, or whether the system hardware is based on the basic input/output system (BIOS) or Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI).

## <span id="Display_miniport_driver_PnP_DDI"></span><span id="display_miniport_driver_pnp_ddi"></span><span id="DISPLAY_MINIPORT_DRIVER_PNP_DDI"></span>Display miniport driver PnP DDI


Starting in Windows 8, the Microsoft DirectX graphics kernel subsystem provides this function that a driver can call if the display device is started or resumed from hibernation:

-   [**DxgkCbAcquirePostDisplayOwnership**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/dispmprt/nc-dispmprt-dxgkcb_acquire_post_display_ownership)

These functions and structure are available for the display miniport driver to implement WDDM 1.2 and later PnP requirements:

-   [*DxgkDdiStopDeviceAndReleasePostDisplayOwnership*](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/dispmprt/nc-dispmprt-dxgkddi_stop_device_and_release_post_display_ownership)
-   [*DxgkDdiSystemDisplayEnable*](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/dispmprt/nc-dispmprt-dxgkddi_system_display_enable)
-   [*DxgkDdiSystemDisplayWrite*](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/dispmprt/nc-dispmprt-dxgkddi_system_display_write)
-   [**DXGK\_DISPLAY\_INFORMATION**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dkmdt/ns-d3dkmdt-_dxgk_display_information)

## <span id="PnP_start_operation"></span><span id="pnp_start_operation"></span><span id="PNP_START_OPERATION"></span>PnP start operation


A Plug and Play (PnP) start process on the display device occurs either during boot or during an upgrade from one display driver to another. In this case the driver must call the [*DxgkCbAcquirePostDisplayOwnership*](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/dispmprt/nc-dispmprt-dxgkcb_acquire_post_display_ownership) function to get information about the frame buffer and to maintain display synchronization. Frame buffer information is provided either from the firmware or from the previous WDDM 1.2 and later driver that was loaded on the system.

During calls the operating system makes to [*DxgkDdiSetPowerState*](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/dispmprt/nc-dispmprt-dxgkddi_set_power_state) function to return to the D0 power state, and to the [*DxgkDdiStartDevice*](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/dispmprt/nc-dispmprt-dxgkddi_start_device) function, the WDDM 1.2 and later driver must set source visibility to false ([**DXGKARG\_SETVIDPNSOURCEVISIBILITY**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dkmddi/ns-d3dkmddi-_dxgkarg_setvidpnsourcevisibility).**Visible** = **FALSE**) for all active video present network (VidPN) targets. In this case the display pipeline hardware must maintain sync signals with the monitor, but the pipeline must continue to send black pixel data to the monitor no matter what pixel data is present in the surface that's currently being scanned out. This means that the pixel pipeline is guaranteed to be blanking the monitor with all black pixels. Later, when the first frame is rendered into the frame buffer, the operating system sets source visibility to true.

All of these procedures keep the monitor synchronized and ensure that the user doesn't see flashes or flickers on the screen.

These are the return codes that the driver should return after a PnP start process.

## <span id="PnP_stop_operation"></span><span id="pnp_stop_operation"></span><span id="PNP_STOP_OPERATION"></span>PnP stop operation


A Plug and Play (PnP) stop process on the display device typically occurs when a driver is being upgraded to a new version. In this case the operating system calls the driver's [*DxgkDdiStopDeviceAndReleasePostDisplayOwnership*](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/dispmprt/nc-dispmprt-dxgkddi_stop_device_and_release_post_display_ownership) function, which requires the driver to provide accurate frame buffer information.

In the [*DxgkDdiStopDeviceAndReleasePostDisplayOwnership*](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/dispmprt/nc-dispmprt-dxgkddi_stop_device_and_release_post_display_ownership) call the driver must ensure that the source visibility for the active VidPn targets is true ([**DXGKARG\_SETVIDPNSOURCEVISIBILITY**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dkmddi/ns-d3dkmddi-_dxgkarg_setvidpnsourcevisibility).**Visible** = **TRUE**). In addition, starting in WDDM 1.2 the driver needs to ensure that the surface that the pixel pipeline is programmed to scan out from is filled with black pixels. The driver should complete filling the surface with black pixels before source visibility is set to true.

Be sure to also implement [*DxgkDdiStopDevice*](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/dispmprt/nc-dispmprt-dxgkddi_stop_device) in your driver. In some cases the operating system might call *DxgkDdiStopDevice* instead of [*DxgkDdiStopDeviceAndReleasePostDisplayOwnership*](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/dispmprt/nc-dispmprt-dxgkddi_stop_device_and_release_post_display_ownership), or after a call to *DxgkDdiStopDeviceAndReleasePostDisplayOwnership* fails.

These are the return codes that the driver should return after a PnP stop process.
