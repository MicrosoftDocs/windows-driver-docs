# Additional Encouraged Configuration Set


## <span id="ddk_additional_encouraged_configuration_set_gg"></span><span id="DDK_ADDITIONAL_ENCOURAGED_CONFIGURATION_SET_GG"></span>


Implementation of additional configurations for software decoders is encouraged. These configurations may exist in hardware and can provide a significant performance benefit relative to those in the [minimal interoperability configuration sets](minimal-interoperability-configuration-sets.md).

This additional configuration set is defined in terms of the members of the [**DXVA\_ConfigPictureDecode**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/dxva/ns-dxva-_dxva_configpicturedecode) structure.
