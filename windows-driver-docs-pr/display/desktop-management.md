# Desktop Management

A display driver must implement [**DrvAssertMode**](/windows/win32/api/winddi/nf-winddi-drvassertmode) and [**DrvGetModes**](/windows/win32/api/winddi/nf-winddi-drvgetmodes) to manage desktops.

If the display driver is palette-managed, it will also receive a call to [**DrvSetPalette**](/windows/win32/api/winddi/nf-winddi-drvsetpalette) to reset its palette to the correct state.

GDI's mechanism for handling dynamic mode changes has changed significantly in Windows 2000 and later operating system versions. The GDI HDEV assigned to a driver during initialization may differ from the HDEV assigned after the mode change is complete. Display drivers will generally be unaffected by this change for the following reasons:

-   Drivers have always assigned *ppdev-&gt;hdevEng = hdev* in their [**DrvCompletePDEV**](/windows/win32/api/winddi/nf-winddi-drvcompletepdev) implementations.

-   Drivers have always referenced *ppdev-&gt;hdevEng* in any callbacks that require an HDEV.
