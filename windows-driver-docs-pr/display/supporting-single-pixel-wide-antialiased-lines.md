# Supporting Single-Pixel-Wide Antialiased Lines

A DirectX 9.0 version driver can support single-pixel-wide lines that are either alias or antialias. The driver indicates antialias support by setting the D3DLINECAPS\_ANTIALIAS capability bit in the **LineCaps** member of the D3DCAPS9 structure. The driver returns a D3DCAPS9 structure in response to a **GetDriverInfo2** query similarly to how it returns a D3DCAPS8 structure as described in [Reporting DirectX 8.0 Style Direct3D Capabilities](reporting-directx-8-0-style-direct3d-capabilities.md). Support of this query is described in [Supporting GetDriverInfo2](supporting-getdriverinfo2.md).

To enable line antialiasing, the driver receives the D3DDP2OP\_RENDERSTATE operation code in the [command stream](command-stream.md) of its [**D3dDrawPrimitives2**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dhal/nc-d3dhal-lpd3dhal_drawprimitives2cb) function. The driver processes the D3DRS\_ANTIALIASEDLINEENABLE render state from the **RenderState** member of the [**D3DHAL\_DP2RENDERSTATE**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dhal/ns-d3dhal-_d3dhal_dp2renderstate) structure that is associated with this operation code. The driver determines whether to enable or disable line antialiasing from the Boolean value in the **dwState** member of D3DHAL\_DP2RENDERSTATE. The value **TRUE** means to enable and **FALSE** means to disable. By default, this render-state value is set to **FALSE**.

The D3DRS\_ANTIALIASEDLINEENABLE render state applies to triangles drawn in wire-frame mode as well as line-drawing primitive types.

When rendering to a multiple-sample render target, the driver must ignore a request to enable line antialiasing and render all lines aliased.
