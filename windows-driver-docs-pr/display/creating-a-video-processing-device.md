# Creating a Video Processing Device


The Microsoft Direct3D runtime calls the user-mode display driver's [**CreateVideoProcessDevice**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dumddi/nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi_createvideoprocessdevice) function to create a device for processing a video stream. When the Direct3D runtime is finished with the device, it calls the user-mode display driver's [**DestroyVideoProcessDevice**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dumddi/nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi_destroyvideoprocessdevice) function.
