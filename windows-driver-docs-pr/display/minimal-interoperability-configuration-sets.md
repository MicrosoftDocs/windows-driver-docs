# Minimal Interoperability Configuration Sets


## <span id="ddk_minimal_interoperability_configuration_sets_gg"></span><span id="DDK_MINIMAL_INTEROPERABILITY_CONFIGURATION_SETS_GG"></span>


All DirectX VA decoders must operate with all DirectX VA accelerators to use a [restricted profile](restricted-profiles.md). Every decoder must be capable of operation with any member of a set of connection configurations, and every accelerator must be capable of operation with at least one member of that set. There are three configuration sets that define the minimal level of functionality that a device driver must provide:

[Compressed Picture Decoding Set](compressed-picture-decoding-set.md)

[Alpha-Blend Data Loading Set](alpha-blend-data-loading-set.md)

[Alpha-Blend Combination Set](alpha-blend-combination-set.md)

For each set the decoder and accelerator must support the same DirectX VA restricted-mode GUID.
