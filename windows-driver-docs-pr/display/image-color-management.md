# Image Color Management

An image displayed on a computer monitor often appears differently when it is printed on a color printer. In recognition of this problem, Windows 2000 and later incorporates Image Color Management (*ICM*) to perform color correction on images so that their appearance is consistent across a variety of output devices.
