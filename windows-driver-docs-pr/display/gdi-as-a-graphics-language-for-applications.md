# GDI as a Graphics Language for Applications

Both the Win32 GDI and the graphics engine are completely device-independent. Consequently, applications do not need to access the hardware directly. Based on an application graphics request, GDI works in conjunction with device-dependent graphics drivers to provide high quality graphics output for an array of graphics devices. The same GDI code paths are used for both printing and display devices.
