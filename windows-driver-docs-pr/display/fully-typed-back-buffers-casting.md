# Fully-Typed Back Buffers Casting


This section applies only to Windows 7 and later operating systems.

Consider resources that are created through a call to the driver's [**CreateResource(D3D10)**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3d10umddi/nc-d3d10umddi-pfnd3d10ddi_createresource) function with the **Format** member of the [**D3D10DDIARG\_CREATERESOURCE**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3d10umddi/ns-d3d10umddi-d3d10ddiarg_createresource) structure set to a format of family DXGI\_FORMAT\_R8G8B8A8\_TYPELESS, DXGI\_FORMAT\_B8G8R8A8\_TYPELESS or DXGI\_FORMAT\_R10G10B10A2\_TYPELESS and with the D3D10\_DDI\_BIND\_PRESENT value set in the **BindFlags** member of **D3D10DDIARG\_CREATERESOURCE**. The Direct3D version 10.1 runtime can subsequently create views (render target or shader resource) on these resources by using any of the fully-typed members of the appropriate family (for example, DXGI\_FORMAT\_B8G8R8A8\_UNORM\_SRGB for the DXGI\_FORMAT\_B8G8R8A8\_TYPELESS family), even if the original resource is created as fully typed. If D3D10\_DDI\_BIND\_PRESENT is not set for the resource, this re-casting is not allowed, as is the case for all fully-typed resources in Direct3D version 10.

This change for Direct3D version 10.1 allows applications to re-view a DXGI\_FORMAT\_R8G8B8A8\_UNORM back buffer as DXGI\_FORMAT\_R8G8B8A8\_UNORM\_SRGB and vice versa. This change also allows applications to cast a DXGI\_FORMAT\_B8G8R8A8\_UNORM\_SRGB back buffer for DXGI\_FORMAT\_B8G8R8A8\_UNORM and to re-view DXGI\_FORMAT\_R10G10B10\_XR\_BIAS\_A2\_UNORM as DXGI\_FORMAT\_R10G10B10A2\_\* for rendering.
