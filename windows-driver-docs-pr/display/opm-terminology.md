<span id="Protection_type"></span><span id="protection_type"></span><span id="PROTECTION_TYPE"></span>**Protection type**  
The type of protection that can be applied to a video signal that is passed through a graphics adapter's connector. More than one type of protection can be applied to a single connector.

The level of protection that is applied to a video signal that is passed through a graphics adapter's connector. The level value is dependent on the protection type. Some protection types (for example, High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection (HDCP)) have only two protection levels (for example, on and off).
