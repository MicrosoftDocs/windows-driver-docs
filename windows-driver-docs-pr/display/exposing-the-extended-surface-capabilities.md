# Exposing the Extended Surface Capabilities

The [**DDCORECAPS**](/windows/win32/api/ddrawi/ns-ddrawi-ddcorecaps) structure contains a [**DDSCAPS**](/previous-versions/windows/hardware/drivers/ff550286(v=vs.85)) field which drivers fill in to indicate what types of surfaces they support. When these caps are reported to the application, a slightly different structure, DDCAPS, is returned. This DDCAPS structure is built from the driver's DDCORECAPS and other structures that are queried using the [**DdGetDriverInfo**](/windows/win32/api/ddrawint/nc-ddrawint-pdd_getdriverinfo) interface. For the latest version of DirectX, the application-visible DDCAPS contains a [**DDSCAPS2**](/previous-versions/windows/hardware/drivers/ff550292(v=vs.85)) member. This DDCAPS2 member is constructed from the DDSCAPS member in the DDCORECAPS structure, and the **ddsCapsMore** member of the [**DD\_MORESURFACECAPS**](/windows/win32/api/ddrawint/ns-ddrawint-dd_moresurfacecaps) structure.

The DD\_MORESURFACECAPS structure is queried from the driver at driver initialization time using the *DdGetDriverInfo* call. The appropriate GUID, as defined in *ddrawint.h*, is GUID\_DDMoreSurfaceCaps.

Responding to the GUID\_DDMoreSurfaceCaps query is entirely optional. It is intended to allow drivers to do two distinct things:

-   Expose extended surface capabilities that the driver can create in display memory.

-   Express to DirectDraw new heap restrictions for these extended surface capabilities.

The first item has been covered in the previous section and is fairly self-explanatory. The second item is more complex, and readers should be familiar with the significance of the **ddsCaps** and **ddsCapsAlt** members of the [**VIDEOMEMORY**](/windows/win32/api/ddrawint/ns-ddrawint-videomemory) structure, described in [Memory Heap Allocation](memory-heap-allocation.md), before reading the next section.
