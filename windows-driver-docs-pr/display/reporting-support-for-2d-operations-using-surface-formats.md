# Reporting Support for 2D Operations Using Surface Formats

The driver specifies flags in the **dwOperations** member of the [**DDPIXELFORMAT**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ksmedia/ns-ksmedia-_ddpixelformat) structure for a surface's format to indicate that it can perform 2D operations using that format.

For example, the driver can indicate that it can copy to or from and color fill to a surface by setting the D3DFORMAT\_OP\_OFFSCREENPLAIN flag.

When the driver uses vendor-supplied codes or codes from the D3DFORMAT enumerated type to set the **dwFourCC** member of DDPIXELFORMAT and assign the format for a surface, the driver can also use the D3DFORMAT\_OP\_CONVERT\_TO\_ARGB and D3DFORMAT\_MEMBEROFGROUP\_ARGB flags to indicate whether color conversion can be performed between source and target surfaces. That is, a target surface that has the D3DFORMAT\_MEMBEROFGROUP\_ARGB flag set indicates that its color format can be converted from any source surface that has the D3DFORMAT\_OP\_CONVERT\_TO\_ARGB flag set.

The driver can only specify the D3DFORMAT\_MEMBEROFGROUP\_ARGB flag for target surface formats with at least 5 bits of color information per channel. That is, the D3DFMT\_A1R5G5B5 format set in the **dwFourCC** member of DDPIXELFORMAT is valid. However, the D3DFMT\_A4R4G4B4 format is invalid. The driver is also constrained to certain source surface formats when specifying the D3DFORMAT\_OP\_CONVERT\_TO\_ARGB flag. Source formats can be any format that is valid for the D3DFORMAT\_MEMBEROFGROUP\_ARGB flag or a *FOURCC* surface format.

Note that although D3DFORMAT\_OP\_CONVERT\_TO\_ARGB and D3DFORMAT\_MEMBEROFGROUP\_ARGB indicate ARGB formats, the runtime also lets the driver specify surfaces with XRGB formats (for example, D3DFMT\_X1R5G5B5). If the driver specifies D3DFORMAT\_MEMBEROFGROUP\_ARGB or D3DFORMAT\_OP\_CONVERT\_TO\_ARGB with an invalid format, the runtime prevents the Direct3D HAL from loading.
