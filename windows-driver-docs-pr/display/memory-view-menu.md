   **Next change** - advances the display to the next memory operation.

   **Previous change** - regresses to display the previous memory operation. 
  
**Go to time** - brings up the *Set time* dialog.

**Sort rows** - brings up the *Choose sorting* dialog.

**Choose columns** - brings up the *Choose columns* dialog.
