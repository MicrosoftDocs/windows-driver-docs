# Supplying Fence Identifiers


The Microsoft DirectX graphics kernel subsystem supplies an identical fence identifier in the **SubmissionFenceId** members of the [**DXGKARG\_PATCH**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dkmddi/ns-d3dkmddi-_dxgkarg_patch) and [**DXGKARG\_SUBMITCOMMAND**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dkmddi/ns-d3dkmddi-_dxgkarg_submitcommand) structures in calls to the display miniport driver's [**DxgkDdiPatch**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dkmddi/nc-d3dkmddi-dxgkddi_patch) and [**DxgkDdiSubmitCommand**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dkmddi/nc-d3dkmddi-dxgkddi_submitcommand) functions. Depending on how the graphics hardware is implemented, the driver is only required to use the fence identifier passed to one of either the *DxgkDdiPatch* or *DxgkDdiSubmitCommand* function for the following reasons:

-   The driver uses the fence identifier passed to *DxgkDdiPatch* to write into the end of the direct memory access (DMA) buffer.

-   The driver uses the fence identifier passed to *DxgkDdiSubmitCommand* to write into the ring buffer, which is the buffer where DMA buffers are queued for execution by the graphics processing unit (GPU) (most GPU types use a DMA buffer queuing model).
