# Head-mounted and specialized monitors

Windows has built-in support for head-mounted displays (HMDs) and other kinds of "specialized" display scenarios. These displays can only be addressed by custom compositors, as they are ignored by the standard Windows system compositor (DWM). In addition, HMDs and specialized displays are given the following properties by Windows:

* Since they are ignored by the system compositor (DWM), the Windows shell cannot be extended to these displays (e.g. wallpaper, desktop icons, taskbar).
* They are not powered on automatically by the OS while the PC is in use.
* They do not receive touch or mouse input.
* They can be acquired for control by apps for dedicated control and presentation, subject to an access model.

Windows Mixed Reality headsets are one example of HMDs controlled by a custom compositor. Similar solutions can be built by third-parties using this documentation.
