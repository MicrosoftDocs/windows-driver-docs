# DirectDraw Surfaces


## <span id="ddk_directdraw_surfaces_gg"></span><span id="DDK_DIRECTDRAW_SURFACES_GG"></span>


The Microsoft DirectDraw Surface is the basic image unit in Microsoft DirectX graphics. It is either a rectangular collection of pixels of a particular width, height, and pixel format; or a buffer containing commands or vertices for Microsoft Direct3D. Surfaces have bits associated with them that denote their behavior and usage. These bits are called *surface capability bits* (or *caps bits* for short). Caps bits denote intended usages of their associated surfaces such as holding texels for rendering (the DDSCAPS\_TEXTURE caps bit), being the target for 3D rendering (DDSCAPS\_3DDEVICE), and many others. For more information about surface caps bits, see the [**DDSCAPS**](/previous-versions/windows/hardware/drivers/ff550286(v=vs.85)) structure.

The *primary* surface is the surface that is currently being scanned out to the monitor by the display card. For more information about the primary surface, see the [Flipping](flipping.md) and [Memory Configurations](memory-configurations.md) sections.
