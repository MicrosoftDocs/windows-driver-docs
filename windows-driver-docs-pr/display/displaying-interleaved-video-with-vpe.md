Many methods exist for deinterlacing. Professional television producers use devices such as line doublers when deinterlacing for large-size rear-projection display, and effects systems with motion-adaptive filters when creating zooms and slow-motion sequences.

Two simple methods are available for displaying interlace on a progressive computer monitor: [bob](bob-method.md) and [weave](weave-method.md). These terms are used here for simplicity, because computer and television industry terms are different.
