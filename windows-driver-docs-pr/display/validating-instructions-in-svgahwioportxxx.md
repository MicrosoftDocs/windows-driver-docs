# Validating Instructions in SvgaHwIoPortXxx

As already mentioned in [VGA-Compatible Miniport Driver's HwVidFindAdapter](vga-compatible-miniport-driver-s-hwvidfindadapter.md), the IOPM set for directly accessible I/O ports usually includes all SVGA registers except the sequencer registers and the miscellaneous output register, which the VGA-compatible miniport driver continues to monitor with its *SvgaHwIoPortXxx* functions. The sequencer registers control internal chip timing on VGA-compatible video adapters. If a full-screen MS-DOS application touches other adapter registers during a synchronous reset, the machine can hang. Likewise, if the miscellaneous output register is set to select a nonexistent clock, the machine can hang.

VGA-compatible miniport drivers must ensure that full-screen MS-DOS applications do not issue instructions that cause the machine to hang. Each such miniport driver must supply *SvgaHwIoPortXxx* functions that monitor application-issued instructions to the I/O ports for the adapter sequencer registers and miscellaneous output register. Each new VGA-compatible miniport driver for an adapter with special features also must monitor and continue to validate any I/O ports to which an application might send any instruction sequence that could hang the machine.

Whenever an application attempts to access the sequencer clock register, the *SvgaHwIoPortXxx* function must change the IOPM in order to trap all instructions coming in during a synchronous reset. As soon as an application sends an instruction that affects the sequencer or attempts to write to the miscellaneous output register, the *SvgaHwIoPortXxx* function should adjust the IOPM by calling [**VideoPortSetTrappedEmulatorPorts**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/video/nf-video-videoportsettrappedemulatorports) to disable direct access to all adapter registers.

The miniport driver-supplied *SvgaHwIoPortXxx* functions should buffer subsequent **IN** (or **INSB/INSW/INSD**) and/or **OUT** (or **OUTSB/OUTSW/OUTSD**) instructions in the **EmulatorAccessEntriesContext** area it set up in the VIDEO\_PORT\_CONFIG\_INFO (see [VGA-Compatible Miniport Driver's HwVidFindAdapter](vga-compatible-miniport-driver-s-hwvidfindadapter.md)) until the synchronous reset is done, or until the application either restores the miscellaneous output register or resets it to a "safe" clock.

Then, the miniport driver is responsible for checking that the buffered instructions cannot hang the machine. If not, the miniport driver should process the buffered instructions, usually by calling [**VideoPortSynchronizeExecution**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/video/nf-video-videoportsynchronizeexecution) with a driver-supplied [*HwVidSynchronizeExecutionCallback*](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/video/nc-video-pminiport_synchronize_routine) function. Otherwise, the miniport driver should discard the buffered instructions.
