# Setting TV Connector and Copy Protection Hardware

For any bit set by a miniport driver in the **dwFlags** member of [**VIDEOPARAMETERS**](/windows/win32/api/tvout/ns-tvout-videoparameters) on a VP\_COMMAND\_GET, the miniport driver can perform a set on a VP\_COMMAND\_SET. It is the caller's responsibility to call the miniport driver to set only that functionality for which the miniport driver indicated support on a VP\_COMMAND\_GET. The miniport driver should respond to a VP\_COMMAND\_SET by setting the hardware with the value of each VIDEOPARAMETERS field for which the corresponding bit is set in **dwFlags**. For example:

-   If the miniport driver set the VP\_FLAGS\_TV\_MODE bit on a VP\_COMMAND\_GET, then the miniport driver should change the TV mode to the value specified by **dwMode** when VP\_FLAGS\_TV\_MODE is set on a VP\_COMMAND\_SET.

-   If the miniport driver set the VP\_FLAGS\_TV\_STANDARD bit on a VP\_COMMAND\_GET, then the miniport driver should change the TV standard to the value specified by **dwTVStandard** when VP\_FLAGS\_TV\_STANDARD is set on a VP\_COMMAND\_SET.

-   If the miniport driver set the VP\_FLAGS\_CONTRAST bit on a VP\_COMMAND\_GET, then the miniport driver should set the contrast to the value specified by **dwContrast** when VP\_FLAGS\_CONTRAST is set on a VP\_COMMAND\_SET.

A VIDEOPARAMETERS field contains undefined data if the corresponding bit is not set in **dwFlags**.
