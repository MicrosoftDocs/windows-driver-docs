| [Microsoft Basic Display Driver](microsoft-basic-display-driver.md) | In Windows 8, The Microsoft Basic Display Driver (MSBDD) is the in-box display driver that replaces the XDDM VGA Save and VGA PnP drivers. |
| [Desktop duplication](desktop-duplication-api.md) | Windows 8 introduces the Microsoft DirectX Graphics Infrastructure (DXGI)-based API to make it easier for independent software vendors (ISVs) to support desktop collaboration and remote desktop access scenarios. |
| [Support for headless systems](support-for-headless-systems.md) | Windows 8 supports booting without any graphics hardware. This is accomplished by using a stub display output if no display devices are found. This stub display is implemented as part of the in-box MSBDD. |
