# GPUView Zoomed Main Window

The following figure shows a screen shot that represents about a frame's worth of data in the GPUView timeline. As you zoom in on the data in the event log, you find a greater level of detail than in the original view. What first appeared black, when zoomed, becomes enhanced with color, size, and location information. Note that the data in the ETL file is symmetrical with regard to logical start and stop operations. This logic enables GPUView to display many different types of events as rectangles that represent objects or functionality lifetimes.

A functional lifetime is displayed as a rectangle or collection of rectangles in the UI. Typically, this functionality has a well-defined start and end location in the file. More information about each functional lifetime will be shown by zooming in on specific areas.
