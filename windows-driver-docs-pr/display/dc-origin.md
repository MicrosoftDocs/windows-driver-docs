Application programs are required to keep their graphics within an array of 2²⁷ by 2²⁷ pixels. The device space has additional size at the graphics DDI level because Window Manager may offset the application's coordinate system by one signed 27-bit coordinate, the *DC origin*. The DC origin is not visible to the driver, and the driver identifies the graphics coordinates only after the offset is applied.
