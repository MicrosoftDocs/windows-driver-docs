# Multiple Session Copy Protection

The miniport driver of a device that has copy protection can optionally support multiple simultaneous copy protection sessions. To do so, the miniport driver should do the following:

-   Return a unique copy protection key in **dwCPKey** for each copy protection activation.

-   Keep copy protection enabled until all sessions have been temporarily turned off (through VP\_CP\_CMD\_CHANGE) or deactivated (VP\_CP\_CMD\_DEACTIVATE). For example, the miniport driver could increment or decrement a reference count every time copy protection is activated (VP\_CP\_CMD\_ACTIVATE) or deactivated/turned off, disabling copy protection entirely only when the reference count is zero.
