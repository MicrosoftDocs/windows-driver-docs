# First Steps For DirectDraw Drivers


## <span id="ddk_first_steps_for_directdraw_drivers_gg"></span><span id="DDK_FIRST_STEPS_FOR_DIRECTDRAW_DRIVERS_GG"></span>


A good way to begin implementing DirectDraw functionality is to modify an existing driver. If no driver is available, start with the sample code in the DirectDraw portion of the Windows Driver Kit (WDK) and get driver initialization, lock, and flip working. From that base functionality, more powerful functionality can be added that will improve display performance.

The minimum driver functionality DirectDraw requires is the ability to lock, unlock, and flip a surface. Assuming the hardware supports the related operations, driver support should also be added for blts (including transparent blts, which are important for speed in games), stretching, and overlays, which are critical for video playback.
