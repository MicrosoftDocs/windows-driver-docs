# Reporting Support for Stream Offsets


## <span id="ddk_reporting_support_for_stream_offsets_gg"></span><span id="DDK_REPORTING_SUPPORT_FOR_STREAM_OFFSETS_GG"></span>


A DirectX 9.0 version driver must indicate support for stream offsets by setting the D3DDEVCAPS2\_STREAMOFFSET capability bit in the **DevCaps2** member of the D3DCAPS9 structure.
