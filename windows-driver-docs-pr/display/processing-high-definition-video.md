# Processing High-Definition Video


This section applies only to Windows 7 and later, and Windows Server 2008 R2 and later versions of Windows operating system.

To more efficiently process video, including high-definition video, a user-mode display driver should implement the DirectX Video Acceleration (VA) High-Definition (DXVA-HD) DDI that ships with Windows 7. The following sections describe the DXVA-HD DDI and programming considerations that you need to be aware of when you use the DXVA-HD DDI in your user-mode display driver.
