# Display Driver Testing Tools

In addition to providing a debugger, Windows 2000 and later operating system versions provide the following tools for testing and debugging your display driver:

-   *newdisp* -- lets you dynamically reload your driver without rebooting the system. See [NewDisp: Dynamic Reload of a Display Driver](newdisp--dynamic-reload-of-a-display-driver.md) for details.

-   Slider control in Control Panel's Display program -- lets you dynamically change the accelerations that GDI will call in your driver. See [Dynamic Change of Permitted Driver Accelerations](dynamic-change-of-permitted-driver-accelerations.md) for details.
