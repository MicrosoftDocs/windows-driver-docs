The MPEG-2 standard is titled "Information Technology âˆ’ Generic Coding of Moving Pictures and Associated Audio Information: Video," ITU-T Recommendation H.262 | ISO/IEC 13818-2. This standard added only a basic 16x8 shape to the existing tools of MPEG-1 (from a very low-layer perspective). From a slightly higher-layer perspective, MPEG-2 added many additional ways to combine predictions referenced from multiple fields in order to deal with interlaced video characteristics.
