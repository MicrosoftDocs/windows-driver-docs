The sorting of the data in the main Segment Viewer window is based on the elements found in the **Active comparers** list. Values can be moved from the **Inactive comparers** list to the **Active comparers** list by selecting the specific item and pressing the arrow button that divides the lists.

The sort order is also dependent on the order of the items in the **Active comparers** list. The topmost item is the primary sort item.

Each Active comparer can be sorted in ascending or descending order. The sort algorithm does its best to perform a simple comparison of the values in the specific column.

The **Move up** and **Move down** buttons adjust the selected Active comparer to the appropriate position up or down.
