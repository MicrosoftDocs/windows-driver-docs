# Keyboard Functionality

The keyboard plays a large role when navigating in GPUView. With many of the menu items, the keystrokes are provided for easy reference. 

## Zooming  

You can use several keystrokes for zooming. The collection is listed in the GPUView menu. To zoom in or out a little, press the A or Z key. Pressing the S and X keys perform the same actions, but with an order of magnitude larger zoom in (or zoom out). If there is a mouse selection and CTRL+Z is pressed, GPUView zooms to the selection time frame. CTRL+H resets the zoom to the home or maximum extent. Pressing the ESC key, when there is no selection, also extends the viewport to its maximum extent. 

## Dialogs  

The different dialogs can be found from the **View** and **Tools** main menu items in GPUView. They all use a combination of the CTRL key plus a letter. For instance, CTRL+M brings up the **Module Info** dialog.

## Charts 

The charts are all based on a combination of the CTRL key plus a function key.

## Levels  

There are a couple of different ways to adjust the thread view level. From the main menu, you can use CTRL+P to toggle through the levels increasing one level at a time or use either the PLUS SIGN (+) or MINUS SIGN (-) key to increase or decrease one level. If you know the level you want to view, press the number pad for that particular level. Supported numbers are 1 through 6.

## VSync 

To quickly enable viewing the first VSync, press the F8 key. The F8 key toggles the show state of the first VSync. 

> [!NOTE]  
> To view the second or third VSync, select the check box in the **Event Listing** dialog.

## Scrolling  

The arrow keys apply directly to the scrolling of the main window. To move a little, press the arrow key in the direction you want the viewport to move over the data. These keystrokes can be combined with the Control (CTRL) key to move a larger increment. PAGE UP and PAGE DOWN also work for scrolling vertically.
