# Patching a DMA Buffer


## <span id="ddk_patching_a_dma_buffer_gg"></span><span id="DDK_PATCHING_A_DMA_BUFFER_GG"></span>


After the video memory manager is informed where every memory resource for the DMA buffer is located, the GPU scheduler calls the display miniport driver's [**DxgkDdiPatch**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dkmddi/nc-d3dkmddi-dxgkddi_patch) function to patch the resource with a physical address (that is, assign a physical address to the resource).
