# Float to XR\_BIAS Conversion Rules


This section applies only to Windows 7 and later operating systems.

The following rules apply for converting float to XR\_BIAS. In these rules, suppose that the starting float value is c.

-   If c is NaN, the result is 0; otherwise, the following rules apply. NaN stands for "not a number," which means a symbolic entity that represents a value not otherwise available in floating-point format.

-   Perform the following operation to convert from float scale to integer scale:

    c = c \* 510

    The preceding operation might induce overflow.

-   Perform the following operation for bias:

    c = c + 384

    The preceding operation might induce overflow.

-   Perform one of the following operations to clamp, depending on the exponent of c:

    If, post bias, the exponent of c is greater than or equal to 2 (&gt;= 2 or c is INF), the result is 0x3ff, which is approximately equivalent to 1.2529.

    If, post bias, the exponent of c is less than 0 (&lt; 0 or c is -INF), the result is 0x0, which represents approximately -0.7529.

-   Re-interpret the most significant 10 bits of the mantissa of c as the result.

The conversion of float to XR\_BIAS is permitted tolerance of 0.6f Unit-Last-Place (ULP) on the XR side. This tolerance means that after converting from float to XR, any value within 0.6f ULP of a represent-capable target format value is permitted to map to that value. Note that 1 ULP of the infinitely precise result means that, for example, an implementation is permitted to truncate results to 32-bit rather than perform round-to-nearest-even, as that would result in an error of at most one unit in the last (least significant) place that is represented in the floating-point number.

The standard Direct3D version 10 requirement for inverting data also applies.
