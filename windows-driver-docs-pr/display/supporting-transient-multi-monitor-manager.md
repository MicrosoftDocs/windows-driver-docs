# Supporting Transient Multi-Monitor Manager

Transient Multi-Monitor Manager is a Windows Vista feature that simplifies the setup of display configurations on mobile computers. TMM can place a mobile computer display (for example, a laptop computer display) into clone view when a new monitor is detected. TMM is disabled on desktop computers. For Windows Vista, there is no GDI function that an application can call to enter clone view. Hardware vendors must continue to use their own proprietary methods to enter clone view on desktop computers. However, hardware vendors should implement and provide an [IViewHelper](/windows/win32/api/cloneviewhelper) COM interface object that will allow TMM to set clone-view mode on mobile computers.
