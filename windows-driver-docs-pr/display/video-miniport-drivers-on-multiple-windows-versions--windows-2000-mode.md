# Video Miniport Drivers on Multiple Windows Versions (Windows 2000 Model)

If you plan to modify a video miniport driver written for Windows NT 4.0 to run on a later NT-based operating system version, see [Converting a Windows NT 4.0 Miniport Driver to Windows 2000](converting-a-windows-nt-4-0-miniport-driver-to-windows-2000.md). You can develop a video miniport driver on a current version of Windows, but have it run on an earlier NT-based Windows version. For details, see [Using VideoPortGetProcAddress](using-videoportgetprocaddress.md).
