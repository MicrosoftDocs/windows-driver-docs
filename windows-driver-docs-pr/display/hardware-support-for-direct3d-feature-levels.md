# Hardware support for Direct3D feature levels


Display device hardware must support Microsoft Direct3D feature levels as described in the following Direct3D topics:

-   [Direct3D feature levels](/windows/desktop/direct3d11/overviews-direct3d-11-devices-downlevel-intro)

-   [10Level9 ID3D11Device Methods](/windows/desktop/direct3d11/d3d11-graphics-reference-10level9-device)

-   [10Level9 ID3D11DeviceContext Methods](/windows/desktop/direct3d11/d3d11-graphics-reference-10level9-context)

-   [Hardware Support for Direct3D 10Level9 Formats](/previous-versions/ff471324(v=vs.85))

In addition, the user-mode driver must expose certain capabilities in Direct3D feature levels 9\_1, 9\_2, and 9\_3 in order for Direct3D features to be properly exposed to applications. These driver topics list the specific capabilities and display formats that the driver must expose:
-   [Required Direct3D 9 capabilities](required-direct3d-9-capabilities.md)

-   [Required DXGI formats](required-dxgi-formats.md)
