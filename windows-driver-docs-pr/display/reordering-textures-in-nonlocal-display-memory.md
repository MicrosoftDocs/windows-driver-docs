# Reordering Textures In Nonlocal Display Memory


## <span id="ddk_reordering_textures_in_nonlocal_display_memory_gg"></span><span id="DDK_REORDERING_TEXTURES_IN_NONLOCAL_DISPLAY_MEMORY_GG"></span>


There are special cases where the driver writer might want to reorder textures in AGP memory to allow more efficient texture management. The DDCAPS2\_SYSTONONLOCAL\_AS\_SYSTOLOCAL flag signals that the driver can support blts from backing surfaces (system memory copy of a surface) to nonlocal video memory using all the same caps that were specified for backing surface memory to local video memory blts.

The DDCAPS2\_SYSTONONLOCAL\_AS\_SYSTOLOCAL flag is valid only if the DDCAPS2\_NONLOCALVIDMEMCAPS flag is set. If DDCAPS2\_SYSTONONLOCAL\_AS\_SYSTOLOCAL is set, then the DDCAPS\_CANBLTSYSMEM flag must be set by the driver and all the associated backing surface blt caps must be correct. DDCAPS2\_SYSTONONLOCAL\_AS\_SYSTOLOCAL signifies that the backing surface to video memory DDCAPS blt caps also apply to backing surface to nonlocal video memory blts. For example, the **dwSVBCaps**, **dwSVBCKeyCaps**, **dwSVBFXCaps**, and **dwSVBRops** members of the [**DDCORECAPS**](/windows/win32/api/ddrawi/ns-ddrawi-ddcorecaps) structure are assumed to be filled in correctly. Any blt from a backing surface to nonlocal memory that matches these caps bits is passed to the driver.

**Note**   This feature is intended to enable the driver itself to do efficient reordering of textures. This is *not* meant to imply that hardware can write into AGP memory. Hardware writing directly into AGP memory is not currently supported.
