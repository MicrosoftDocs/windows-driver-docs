# Operations That Can Be IRP-Based or Fast I/O

The following types of operations can be IRP-based or fast I/O operations:

-   IRP\_MJ\_DEVICE\_CONTROL. (Note that IRP\_MJ\_INTERNAL\_DEVICE\_CONTROL is always IRP-based.)

-   IRP\_MJ\_QUERY\_INFORMATION. This operation can be fast I/O if the **FileInformationClass** parameter is **FileBasicInformation**, **FileStandardInformation**, or **FileNetworkOpenInformation**.

-   IRP\_MJ\_READ. Minifilter drivers can set the FLTFL\_OPERATION\_REGISTRATION\_SKIP\_CACHED\_IO flag in the [**FLT\_OPERATION\_REGISTRATION**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/fltkernel/ns-fltkernel-_flt_operation_registration) structure to avoid receiving fast I/O IRP\_MJ\_READ operations and cached IRP-based reads.

-   IRP\_MJ\_WRITE. Minifilter drivers can set the FLTFL\_OPERATION\_REGISTRATION\_SKIP\_CACHED\_IO flag in the FLT\_OPERATION\_REGISTRATION structure to avoid receiving fast I/O IRP\_MJ\_WRITE operations and cached IRP-based writes.

When any of these operations is a fast I/O operation, it always uses neither buffered nor direct I/O, even if the equivalent IRP-based operation uses a different buffering method.

When IRP\_MJ\_DEVICE\_CONTROL is a fast I/O operation, it always uses neither buffered nor direct I/O, regardless of the IOCTL's transfer type.

Although IRP\_MJ\_LOCK\_CONTROL can be an IRP-based or fast I/O operation, it has no buffers.
