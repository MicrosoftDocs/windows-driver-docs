# Repudiation


## <span id="ddk_repudiation_if"></span><span id="DDK_REPUDIATION_IF"></span>


The concept of repudiation is that a user might perform a particular operation, and then subsequently deny having performed it. For most drivers this is an unusual type of issue. For a file system, however, logging is used to track operations (deletion of important files, for example) and ensure that there is a clear trail of operations. This provides a mechanism for ensuring against such repudiation.

Additionally, the operating system can assign ownership of objects to specific security identifiers. The ownership information cannot be changed without appropriate privileges (**SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege**) in order to ensure that ownership of specific objects can be tracked. Object ownership provides another form of protection against repudiation.
