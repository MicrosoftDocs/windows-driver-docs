# FSCTL\_GET\_WOF\_VERSION control code


The **FSCTL\_GET\_WOF\_VERSION** I/O control code (IOCTL) is used to query the version of the driver used to support a particular provider.

To perform this operation, call [**FltFsControlFile**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff542988) or [**ZwFsControlFile**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff566462) with the following parameters.

``` syntax
BOOL 
   WINAPI 
   DeviceIoControl( (HANDLE)       hDevice,         // handle to device
                    (DWORD)        FSCTL_GET_WOF_VERSION, // dwIoControlCode
                    (LPDWORD)      lpInBuffer,      // input buffer
                    (DWORD)        nInBufferSize,   // size of input buffer
                    (LPDWORD)      lpOutBuffer,     // output buffer
                    (DWORD)        nOutBufferSize,  // size of output buffer
                    (LPDWORD)      lpBytesReturned, // number of bytes returned
                    (LPOVERLAPPED) lpOverlapped );  // OVERLAPPED structure
```

**Parameters**

<a href="" id="hdevice--in-"></a>*hDevice \[in\]*  
A handle to the device. To obtain a device handle, call the [**CreateFile**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/aa363858) function or similar API.

<a href="" id="dwiocontrolcode--in-"></a>*dwIoControlCode \[in\]*  
The control code for the operation. Use **FSCTL\_GET\_WOF\_VERSION** for this operation.

<a href="" id="lpinbuffer"></a>*lpInBuffer*  
The input buffer for the operation. This is a pointer to a [**WOF\_EXTERNAL\_INFO**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/dn632452) structure.

<a href="" id="ninbuffersize--in-"></a>*nInBufferSize \[in\]*  
The size, in bytes, of the input buffer. This should be **sizeof**([**WOF\_EXTERNAL\_INFO**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/dn632452)).

<a href="" id="lpoutbuffer--out-"></a>*lpOutBuffer \[out\]*  
The output buffer for the operation. This is a pointer to a [**WOF\_VERSION\_INFO**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/mt426742) structure.

<a href="" id="noutbuffersize--in-"></a>*nOutBufferSize \[in\]*  
The size, in bytes, of the output buffer. This should be **sizeof**([**WOF\_VERSION\_INFO**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/mt426742)).

<a href="" id="lpbytesreturned--out-"></a>*lpBytesReturned \[out\]*  
**LPDWORD**

A pointer to a variable that receives the size of the data stored in the output buffer, in bytes.

If the output buffer is too small, the call fails, [**GetLastError**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms679360) returns **ERROR\_INSUFFICIENT\_BUFFER**, and *lpBytesReturned* is zero.

If *lpOverlapped* is **NULL**, *lpBytesReturned* cannot be **NULL**. Even when an operation returns no output data and *lpOutBuffer* is **NULL**, [**DeviceIoControl**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/aa363216) makes use of *lpBytesReturned*. After such an operation, the value of *lpBytesReturned* is meaningless.

If *lpOverlapped* is not **NULL**, *lpBytesReturned* can be **NULL**. If this parameter is not **NULL** and the operation returns data, *lpBytesReturned* is meaningless until the overlapped operation has completed. To retrieve the number of bytes returned, call [**GetOverlappedResult**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms683209). If the *hDevice* parameter is associated with an I/O completion port, you can retrieve the number of bytes returned by calling [**GetQueuedCompletionStatus**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/aa364986).

<a href="" id="lpoverlapped--in-"></a>*lpOverlapped \[in\]*  
**LPOVERLAPPED**

A pointer to an [**OVERLAPPED**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms684342) structure.

If *hDevice* was opened without specifying **FILE\_FLAG\_OVERLAPPED**, *lpOverlapped* is ignored.

If *hDevice* was opened with the **FILE\_FLAG\_OVERLAPPED** flag, the operation is performed as an overlapped (asynchronous) operation. In this case, *lpOverlapped* must point to a valid [**OVERLAPPED**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms684342) structure that contains a handle to an event object. Otherwise, the function fails in unpredictable ways.

For overlapped operations, [**DeviceIoControl**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/aa363216) returns immediately, and the event object is signaled when the operation has been completed. Otherwise, the function does not return until the operation has been completed or an error occurs.

Status block
------------

If the operation completes successfully, [**DeviceIoControl**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/aa363216) returns a nonzero value.

If the operation fails or is pending, [**DeviceIoControl**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/aa363216) returns zero. To get extended error information, call [**GetLastError**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms679360).
