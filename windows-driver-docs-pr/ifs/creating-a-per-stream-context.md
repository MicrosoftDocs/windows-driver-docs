# Creating a Per-Stream Context

> [!NOTE]
> For optimal reliability and performance, use [file system minifilter drivers](filter-manager-concepts.md) with Filter Manager support instead of legacy file system filter drivers. To port your legacy driver to a minifilter driver, see [Guidelines for Porting Legacy Filter Drivers](guidelines-for-porting-legacy-filter-drivers.md).

Legacy file system filter drivers that use a per-stream context structure containing a [**FSRTL_PER_STREAM_CONTEXT**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ntifs/ns-ntifs-_fsrtl_per_stream_context) structure can take advantage of built-in per-stream context support in Windows XP and later.

A file system filter driver typically creates a [per-stream context structure](file-streams--stream-contexts--and-per-stream-contexts.md) for a file stream when the file stream is first opened. However, a per-stream context structure can be created and associated with a file stream during any operation.

## Allocating the Per-Stream Context

Per-stream context structures can be allocated from paged or nonpaged pool. To allocate a per-stream context, call [**ExAllocatePoolWithTag**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-exallocatepoolwithtag) as shown in the following example:

```cpp
contextSize = sizeof(SPY_STREAM_CONTEXT) + fileName.Length;
ctx = ExAllocatePoolWithTag(NonPagedPool,
                            contextSize,
                            MYLEGACYFILTER_CONTEXT_TAG);
```

If your filter allocates the per-stream context structure from paged pool, it can't call [**ExAllocatePoolWithTag**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-exallocatepoolwithtag) from its create completion routine. This is because completion routines can be called at IRQL DISPATCH_LEVEL.

### Initializing the Per-Stream Context

File system filter drivers call [**FsRtlInitPerStreamContext**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ntifs/nf-ntifs-fsrtlinitperstreamcontext) to initialize a per-stream context structure. This routine initializes the FSRTL_PER_STREAM_CONTEXT portion of the context structure. (The remainder of the structure is filter-driver-specific.)

If your filter driver creates only one per-stream context structure per file stream, it should pass **NULL** for the *InstanceId* parameter to [**FsRtlInitPerStreamContext**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ntifs/nf-ntifs-fsrtlinitperstreamcontext).

A filter driver can initialize a per-stream context at any time. However, it must do so before associating the context with a file stream.
