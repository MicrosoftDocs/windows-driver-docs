# IRP-Based I/O Operations That Obey Device Object Flags

The buffering method for the following IRP-based I/O operations is determined by the value of the **Flags** member of the [**DEVICE\_OBJECT**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/ns-wdm-_device_object) structure for the file system volume:

-   IRP\_MJ\_DIRECTORY\_CONTROL

-   IRP\_MJ\_QUERY\_EA

-   IRP\_MJ\_QUERY\_QUOTA

-   IRP\_MJ\_READ

-   IRP\_MJ\_SET\_EA

-   IRP\_MJ\_SET\_QUOTA

-   IRP\_MJ\_WRITE

The DO\_BUFFERED\_IO and DO\_DIRECT\_IO flags in the **Flags** member are used as follows:

-   If the DO\_BUFFERED\_IO flag is set, the operation uses buffered I/O.

-   If the DO\_DIRECT\_IO flag is set and the DO\_BUFFERED\_IO flag is not set, the operation uses direct I/O.

-   If neither flag is set, the operation uses neither buffered nor direct I/O.

For more information about device object flags, see [**DEVICE\_OBJECT**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/ns-wdm-_device_object) and [Initializing a Device Object](../kernel/initializing-a-device-object.md).

Note that IRP\_MJ\_READ and IRP\_MJ\_WRITE can be IRP-based or fast I/O operations. When they are IRP-based, the buffering method is determined by the device object flags as described above. When these operations are fast I/O, they always use neither buffered nor direct I/O. For more information about I/O operations that can be IRP-based or fast I/O operations, see [Operations That Can Be IRP-Based or Fast I/O](operations-that-can-be-irp-based-or-fast-i-o.md).
