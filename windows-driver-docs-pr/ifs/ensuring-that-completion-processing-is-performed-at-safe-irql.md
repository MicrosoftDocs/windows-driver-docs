# Ensuring that Completion Processing is Performed at Safe IRQL

As noted in [Writing Postoperation Callback Routines](writing-postoperation-callback-routines.md), the [**postoperation callback routine**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/fltkernel/nc-fltkernel-pflt_post_operation_callback) for an IRP-based I/O operation can be called at IRQL = DISPATCH\_LEVEL, unless the minifilter driver's preoperation callback routine synchronized the operation by returning FLT\_PREOP\_SYNCHRONIZE or the operation is a create operation, which is inherently synchronous. (For more information about this return value, see [Returning FLT\_PREOP\_SYNCHRONIZE](returning-flt-preop-synchronize.md).)

However, for IRP-based I/O operations that are not already synchronized, minifilter drivers can use to two techniques to ensure that completion processing is performed at IRQL &lt;= APC\_LEVEL.

The first technique is for the postoperation callback routine to pend the I/O operation until completion processing can be performed at IRQL &lt;= APC\_LEVEL. This technique is described in [Pending an I/O Operation in a Postoperation Callback Routine](pending-an-i-o-operation-in-a-postoperation-callback-routine.md).

The second technique is for the minifilter driver's postoperation callback routine to call [**FltDoCompletionProcessingWhenSafe**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/fltkernel/nf-fltkernel-fltdocompletionprocessingwhensafe). **FltDoCompletionProcessingWhenSafe** pends the I/O operation only if the current IRQL is &gt;= DISPATCH\_LEVEL. Otherwise, this routine executes the minifilter driver's **SafePostCallback** routine immediately. This technique is described in **FltDoCompletionProcessingWhenSafe**.
