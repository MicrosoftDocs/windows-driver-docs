# Implementing File Systems to Minimize Security Threats


## <span id="ddk_implementing_to_minimize_security_threats_if"></span><span id="DDK_IMPLEMENTING_TO_MINIMIZE_SECURITY_THREATS_IF"></span>


Implementation problems that pose security threats fall into a set of common issues:

-   Buffer handling.

-   Authentication and identification.

-   Access control.

-   Handle management.

None of these issues is particularly novel. These issues are well known, yet these problems recur in drivers. Part of the problem is that most existing development tools do not warn users or mitigate against these types of problems. However, using judicious defensive development techniques, most of these problems can be eliminated.

This section includes the following topics:

[Buffer Handling](buffer-handling.md)

[Authentication and Identification](authentication-and-identification.md)

[Access Control](access-control.md)

[Handle Management](handle-management.md)
