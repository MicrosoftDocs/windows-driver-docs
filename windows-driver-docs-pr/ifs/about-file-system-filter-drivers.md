# About file system filter drivers

## File system filter drivers on Windows

A *file system filter driver* is an optional driver that adds value to or modifies the behavior of a file system. It is a kernel-mode component that runs as part of the Windows executive.

A file system filter driver can filter I/O operations for one or more file systems or file system volumes. Depending on the nature of the driver, *filter* can mean *log*, *observe*, *modify*, or even *prevent*. Typical applications for file system filter drivers include antivirus utilities, encryption programs, and hierarchical storage management systems.

There are two file system filter models in Windows:

- The [minifilter model](./filter-manager-concepts.md), in which a "minifilter" filter uses system-supplied Filter Manager (*FltMgr*) support, thus simplifying filter development

- The [legacy file system filter model](./about-file-system-legacy-filter-drivers.md)

> [!NOTE]
> Filter developers should develop [file system minifilter drivers](./filter-manager-concepts.md) with Filter Manager support instead of legacy file system filter drivers.  See [Guidelines for Porting Legacy Filter Drivers](guidelines-for-porting-legacy-filter-drivers.md) to port any remaining legacy filters to be minifilter drivers.

## File system filter drivers are not device drivers

A *device driver* is a software component that controls a particular hardware I/O device. For example, a DVD storage driver controls a DVD drive.

In contrast, a *file system filter driver* works in conjunction with one or more file systems to manage file I/O operations. These operations include:

- Creating, opening, closing, and enumerating files and directories

- Getting and setting file, directory, and volume information

- Reading and writing file data

In addition, file system filter drivers must support file system-specific features such as caching, locking, sparse files, disk quotas, compression, security, recoverability, reparse points, and volume mount points.
