# Checking the Oplock State of an IRP_MJ_CREATE operation


The following only applies when an existing stream of a file is being opened (that is, newly created streams cannot have pre-existing oplocks on them).

**Note**  When processing IRP_MJ_CREATE for any oplock, if the desired access contains nothing other than FILE_READ_ATTRIBUTES, FILE_WRITE_ATTRIBUTES, or SYNCHRONIZE, the oplock does not break unless FILE_RESERVE_OPFILTER is specified. Specifying FILE_RESERVE_OPFILTER always results in an oplock break if the create succeeds. For brevity and simplicity, the following table omits the foregoing, since it applies to all oplocks.

The file system performs additional checks for Batch and Filter oplocks (rather than the oplock package itself) when processing an IRP_MJ_CREATE operation, which impact whether the file system asks the oplock package to perform oplock break processing. This is a case where operations on one data stream can impact the oplocks on other data streams of the same file (that is, the last two list items of the following criteria list). If one or more of the following criteria are met, the file system sends a request to the oplock package to perform oplock break processing:

-   Request a break if this is a network query open and a [KTM](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=124745) transaction is present. Otherwise, do not request a break on network query open.

-   If a SUPERSEDE, OVERWRITE or OVERWRITE_IF operation is performed on an alternate data stream and FILE_SHARE_DELETE is not specified and there is a Batch or Filter oplock on the primary data stream, request a break of the Batch or Filter oplock on the primary data stream.

-   If a SUPERSEDE, OVERWRITE or OVERWRITE_IF operation is performed on the primary data stream and DELETE access has been requested and there are Batch or Filter oplocks on any alternate data stream, request a break of the Batch or Filter oplocks on all alternate data streams that have them.

When the file system decides to ask the oplock package to perform oplock break processing, the rules laid out in the preceding table apply.

The check to break Batch and Filter oplocks occurs before the share access checks are made. This means the Batch or Filter oplock is broken even if the open request ultimately fails due to a sharing violation.
