A major concern when developing a file system that supports removable media (FASTFAT, for example) is guarding against the "disk of death" attack. When implementing a file system, the driver must guard against maliciously malformed structures since anyone can insert a removable disk (CD-ROM, DVD-ROM, or USB flash memory disk, for example) into the system.
