# File system sample code

In almost all situations, developing a full file system driver for Windows is not necessary. If you do decide to develop a new file system driver, the [*fastfat* sample](../samples/file-system-driver-samples.md) is available for you to use as a model. To learn how to install a file system driver, see [Creating an INF File for a File System Driver](creating-an-inf-file-for-a-file-system-driver.md).

The WDK does not provide conceptual documentation for file system development.

Most file system-related development on Windows involves the creation of a file system filter (or "minifilter") driver that interacts with the system-supplied [Filter Manager](filter-manager-concepts.md).
