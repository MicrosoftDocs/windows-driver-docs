# The FOBX Structure


## <span id="ddk_the_fobx_structure_if"></span><span id="DDK_THE_FOBX_STRUCTURE_IF"></span>


A file object extension (FOBX) structure is an RDBSS extension to the [**FILE\_OBJECT**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/ns-wdm-_file_object) structure. The FOBX structure is pointed to by the **FileObjectExtension** field in the file object. An FOBX structure contains the following:

-   A signature and reference count

-   A backpointer to the associated FCB structure

-   A backpointer to the associated SRV\_OPEN structure

-   Context information about this open structure

-   Additional storage requested by the network mini-redirector or the creator of the FOBX structure

The FOBX structure contains all of the information that is needed, per file object, which is not normally stored by the I/O system. Information about file objects is stored by the I/O system in fixed-size file system objects. The FOBX structure handles the other information needed on file objects by network mini-redirectors.

The FOBX structure for any file object is referenced by the **FsContext2** field in the file object. Even though the FOBX structure is ordinarily a terminus in the RDBSS structure, the FOBX structure is currently reference counted anyway.

The FOBX flags are split into two groups:

-   Flags visible to network mini-redirectors

-   Flags used internally by RDBSS and invisible to network mini-redirectors

The flags visible to network mini-redirectors consist of the lower 16 bits of the possible FOBX flags. The upper 16 bits are reserved for use internally by RDBSS.
