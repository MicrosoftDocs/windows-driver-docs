# Installing a filter driver

File system filter driver developers use an INF file to install and upgrade a driver. You can use the INF file alone or together with a batch file or a user-mode setup application.

This section includes:

* [Creating an INF File for a filter driver](creating-an-inf-file-for-a-minifilter-driver.md)
* [Load order groups and altitudes for filter drivers](load-order-groups-and-altitudes-for-minifilter-drivers.md)
* [Allocated altitudes](allocated-altitudes.md)
* [Filter altitude request](minifilter-altitude-request.md)
* [Reparse point tag request](reparse-point-tag-request.md)
