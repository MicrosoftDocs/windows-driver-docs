# IRP_MJ_SHUTDOWN (FS and filter drivers)

## When Sent

The I/O Manager or a file system driver sends the IRP_MJ_SHUTDOWN request when the system is being shut down.

## Operation: File System Drivers

The file system should perform any necessary cleanup and complete the IRP with STATUS_SUCCESS.

## Operation: Legacy File System Filter Drivers

The filter driver should pass this IRP down to the next-lower driver on the stack.

## Parameters

A file system or filter driver calls [**IoGetCurrentIrpStackLocation**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-iogetcurrentirpstacklocation) for the given IRP to get a pointer to its own stack location in the IRP. In the following parameters, **Irp** points to the [**IRP**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/ns-wdm-_irp) and **IrpSp** points to the [**IO_STACK_LOCATION**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/ns-wdm-_io_stack_location). The driver can use the information that is set in the following members of the IRP and the IRP stack location to process a shutdown request:

- **DeviceObject** is a pointer to the target device object.

- **Irp->IoStatus** points to an [**IO_STATUS_BLOCK**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/ns-wdm-_io_status_block) structure that receives the final completion status and information about the requested operation.

- **IrpSp->MajorFunction** is set to IRP_MJ_SET_SHUTDOWN.
