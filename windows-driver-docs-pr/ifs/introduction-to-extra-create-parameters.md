# About Extra Create Parameters (ECPs)

Extra create parameters (ECPs) are structures that can contain additional information for file creates. A create operation can have any number of ECPs, which are attached to the operation using an **ECP_LIST**. **ECP_LIST** is an opaque structure declared in *ntifs.h*.

There are two types of ECPs:

* System-defined ECPs. Operating system components use system-defined ECPs to associate additional information with the [**IRP_MJ_CREATE**](./irp-mj-create.md) operation on a file.

* User-defined (or driver-defined) ECPs. Drivers can also use ECPs to process or associate additional information with the IRP_MJ_CREATE operation on a file in the following situations:

  * When a kernel-mode driver calls the [**FltCreateFileEx2**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/fltkernel/nf-fltkernel-fltcreatefileex2) or [**IoCreateFileEx**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/ntddk/nf-ntddk-iocreatefileex) routine to create or open the file.

  * When a file system filter driver processes the [**IRP_MJ_CREATE**](./irp-mj-create.md) operation for the file

The following sections describe how to define, attach, and use ECPs, and list system-defined ECPs.
