# About File System Legacy Filter Drivers

The information in this section is for developers who are maintaining an existing legacy filter driver. The legacy file system filter model has been replaced by [Filter Manager and minifilter drivers](./filter-manager-concepts.md).

> [!NOTE]
> For optimal reliability and performance, use [file system minifilter drivers](./filter-manager-concepts.md) with Filter Manager support instead of legacy file system filter drivers. To port your legacy driver to a minifilter driver, see [Guidelines for Porting Legacy Filter Drivers](guidelines-for-porting-legacy-filter-drivers.md).
