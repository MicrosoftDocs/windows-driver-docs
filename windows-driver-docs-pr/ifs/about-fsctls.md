# About FSCTLs

A file system control code (FSCTL) is a command issued to a file system in order to:

* Alter or query the behavior of the file system, and/or
* To set or query metadata that is associated with a particular file or with the file system itself.

Filter drivers can issue FSCTLs, as can applications. This section provides reference pages for FSCTLs with details on how filter drivers use them.
