# User-defined ECPs

A filter driver can define its own extra create parameters (ECPs). To define your own ECP:

* Define a GUID that identifies your ECP.

* Define a context structure that describes your ECP.

See [System-defined ECPs](system-defined-ecps.md) for examples of system-defined GUIDs and associated context structures.

For information about how to define GUIDs and using them in driver code, see [Using GUIDs in Drivers](../kernel/using-guids-in-drivers.md).
