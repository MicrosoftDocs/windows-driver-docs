# MRxQueryVolumeInfo routine


The *MRxQueryVolumeInfo* routine is called by [RDBSS](./the-rdbss-driver-and-library.md) to request that a network mini-redirector query volume information.

## Syntax

```ManagedCPlusPlus
PMRX_CALLDOWN MRxQueryVolumeInfo;

NTSTATUS MRxQueryVolumeInfo(
  _Inout_Â PRX_CONTEXT RxContext
)
{ ... }
```

## Parameters

*RxContext* \[in, out\]  
A pointer to the RX\_CONTEXT structure. This parameter contains the IRP that is requesting the operation.

## Return value

*MRxQueryVolumeInfo* returns STATUS\_SUCCESS on success or an appropriate NTSTATUS value, such as one of the following:

## Remarks

RDBSS issues a call to *MRxQueryVolumeInfo* in either of the following cases:

-   RDBSS receives an [**IRP\_MJ\_QUERY\_VOLUME\_INFORMATION**](irp-mj-query-volume-information.md) request.

-   RDBSS receives an [**IRP\_MJ\_FILE\_SYSTEM\_CONTROL**](irp-mj-file-system-control.md) request for an FSCTL\_LMR\_GET\_LINK\_TRACKING\_INFORMATION control code.

Before calling *MRxQueryVolumeInfo* in the case of an IRP\_MJ\_QUERY\_VOLUME\_INFORMATION request, RDBSS modifies the following members in the RX\_CONTEXT structure pointed to by the *RxContext* parameter:

The **Info.FsInformationClass** member is set to **IrpSp-&gt;Parameters.QueryVolume.FsInformationClass**.

The **Info.Buffer** member is set to **Irp-&gt;AssociatedIrp.SystemBuffer**.

The **Info.LengthRemaining** member is set to **IrpSp-&gt;Parameters.QueryVolume.Length**.

For an IRP\_MJ\_QUERY\_VOLUME\_INFORMATION request, if the **PostRequest** member of the RX\_CONTEXT structure is **TRUE** on return from *MRxQueryVolumeInfo*, RDBSS will call [**RxFsdPostRequest**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/rxprocs/nf-rxprocs-rxfsdpostrequest) to post the request. For this case, the IRP\_MJ\_QUERY\_VOLUME\_INFORMATION request will pass the RX\_CONTEXT structure to queue RX\_CONTEXT to a worker queue for processing by the file system process (FSP).

If the **PostRequest** member of the RX\_CONTEXT structure is **FALSE** on return from *MRxQueryVolumeInfo*, the network mini-redirector must set the **Info.LengthRemaining** member of the RX\_CONTEXT structure to the length of the volume information returned. RDBSS sets the **IoStatus.Information** member of the IRP to **IrpSp-&gt;Parameters.QueryVolume.Length** minus the **Info.LengthRemaining** member of the RX\_CONTEXT structure.

If the call to *MRxQueryVolumeInfo* is successful, the network mini-redirector should set the **Info.LengthRemaining** member of the RX\_CONTEXT structure to the **Info.Length** member minus the length of the volume information returned. If the call to *MRxQueryVolumeInfo* was successful, RDBSS sets the **IoStatus.Information** member of the IRP to **IrpSp-&gt;Parameters.QueryVolume.Length** minus the **Info.LengthRemaining** member of the RX\_CONTEXT structure.

For an IRP\_MJ\_QUERY\_VOLUME\_INFORMATION request with the **Info.FsInformationClass** member set to **FileFsDeviceInformation**, the network mini-redirector returns the following information in the RX\_CONTEXT structure pointed to by the *RxContext* parameter:

The **Info.Buffer** member contains an FILE\_FS\_DEVICE\_INFORMATION structure

The **Info.Buffer.Characteristics** member is set to the characteristics of the volume, which must include FILE\_REMOTE\_DEVICE as one of the options.

The **Info.Buffer.DeviceType** member is set to the **DeviceType** member of the associated NET\_ROOT structure. If the **Type** member of the associated NET\_ROOT is NET\_ROOT\_PIPE, **Info.Buffer.DeviceType** member is set to FILE\_DEVICE\_NAMED\_PIPE.

For an IRP\_MJ\_QUERY\_VOLUME\_INFORMATION request with the **Info.FsInformationClass** member set to **FileFsVolumeInformation**, the network mini-redirector returns the following information in the RX\_CONTEXT structure pointed to by the *RxContext* parameter:

The **Info.Buffer** member contains a FILE\_FS\_VOLUME\_INFORMATION structure.

The **Info.Buffer** member is set to the **VolumeInfo** member of the associated NET\_ROOT structure.

The **Info.LengthRemaining** member is set to the **VolumeInfoLength** member of the associated NET\_ROOT structure.

An *MRxQueryVolumeInfo* call from RDBSS for [**IRP\_MJ\_FILE\_SYSTEM\_CONTROL**](irp-mj-file-system-control.md) is a request for the link tracking information. Before calling *MRxQueryVolumeInfo* for IRP\_MJ\_FILE\_SYSTEM\_CONTROL, RDBSS modifies the following members in the RX\_CONTEXT structure pointed to by the *RxContext* parameter:

The **Info.FsInformationClass** member is set to **FileFsObjectIdInformation**.

The **Info.Buffer** member is set to a FILE\_FS\_OBJECTID\_INFORMATION structure.

The **Info.LengthRemaining** member is set to **sizeof**(FILE\_FS\_OBJECTID\_INFORMATION).

For this case of an IRP\_MJ\_FILE\_SYSTEM\_CONTROL request, the **AssociatedIrp.SystemBuffer** member of the IRP points to a LINK\_TRACKING\_INFORMATION structure.

If a request is initiated as an IRP\_MJ\_FILE\_SYSTEM\_CONTROL to *MRxQueryVolumeInfo* with a return value of STATUS\_SUCCESS or STATUS\_BUFFER\_OVERFLOW, RDBSS copies the **ObjectId** member of the FILE\_FS\_OBJECTID\_INFORMATION structure passed in the **Info.Buffer** member of RX\_CONTEXT structure to the **NetRoot-&gt;DiskParameters.VolumeId** member of the FCB structure and to the **AssociatedIrp.SystemBuffer.VolumeId** member of the IRP. If the call to *MRxQueryVolumeInfo* was successful, RDBSS sets the **Type** member of the LINK\_TRACKING\_INFORMATION structure. If the **NetRoot-&gt;Flags** member of the FCB structure has the NETROOT\_FLAG\_DFS\_AWARE\_NETROOT bit set, the **Type** member is set by RDBSS to **DfsLinkTrackingInformation**. If the **NetRoot-&gt;Flags** member of the FCB structure does not have the NETROOT\_FLAG\_DFS\_AWARE\_NETROOT bit set, the **Type** member is set by RDBSS to **NtfsLinkTrackingInformation**. On success, RDBSS sets the **IoStatus.Information** member of the IRP to the size of a LINK\_TRACKING\_INFORMATION structure.
