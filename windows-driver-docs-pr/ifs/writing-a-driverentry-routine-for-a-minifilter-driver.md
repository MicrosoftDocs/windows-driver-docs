# Writing a DriverEntry Routine for a Minifilter Driver

Every file system minifilter driver must have a [**DriverEntry**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nc-wdm-driver_initialize) routine. The **DriverEntry** routine is called when the minifilter driver is loaded.

The **DriverEntry** routine performs global initialization, registers the minifilter driver, and initiates filtering. This routine runs in a system thread context at IRQL PASSIVE\_LEVEL.

The **DriverEntry** routine is defined as follows:

```cpp
NTSTATUS 
(*PDRIVER_INITIALIZE) ( 
    IN PDRIVER_OBJECT DriverObject, 
    IN PUNICODE_STRING RegistryPath 
    ); 
```

**DriverEntry** has two input parameters. The first, *DriverObject*, is the driver object that was created when the minifilter driver was loaded. The second, *RegistryPath*, is a pointer to a counted Unicode string that contains a path to the minifilter driver's registry key.

A minifilter driver's **DriverEntry** routine must perform the following steps, in order:

1.  Perform any needed global initialization for the minifilter driver.

2.  Register the minifilter driver by calling [**FltRegisterFilter**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/fltkernel/nf-fltkernel-fltregisterfilter).

3.  Initiate filtering by calling [**FltStartFiltering**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/fltkernel/nf-fltkernel-fltstartfiltering).

4.  Return an appropriate NTSTATUS value.
