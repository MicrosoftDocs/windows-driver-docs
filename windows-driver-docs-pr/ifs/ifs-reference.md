# Additional Reference

Most reference pages related to file system-related development are found under [File system](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/_ifsk/) in the [Programming reference for Windows Driver Kit (WDK)](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/).

This section contains additional reference pages. It will eventually be migrated to be under the File system section linked above.
