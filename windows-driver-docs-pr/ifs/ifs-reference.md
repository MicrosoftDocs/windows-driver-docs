# Additional Reference

Most reference pages related to file system-related development are found under [File system](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/_ifsk/) in the [Programming reference for Windows Driver Kit (WDK)](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/).

This section contains additional reference pages. It will eventually be migrated to be under the File system section linked above.
