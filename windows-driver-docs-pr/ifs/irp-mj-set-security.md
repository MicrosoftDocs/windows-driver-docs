# IRP_MJ_SET_SECURITY (FS and filter drivers)

## When Sent

The I/O Manager sends the IRP_MJ_SET_SECURITY request. This request can be sent, for example, when a user-mode application has called a Win32 function such as **SetSecurityInfo**.

## Operation: File System Drivers

The file system driver should extract and decode the file object to determine whether it represents a user file or directory open. If it does, the driver should process the request and complete the IRP. Otherwise, the driver should complete the IRP as appropriate without processing the request.

## Operation: Legacy File System Filter Drivers

The filter driver should pass this IRP down to the next-lower driver on the stack.

## Parameters

A file system or filter driver calls [**IoGetCurrentIrpStackLocation**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-iogetcurrentirpstacklocation) for the given IRP to get a pointer to its own stack location in the IRP. In the following parameters, **Irp** points to the [**IRP**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/ns-wdm-_irp) and **IrpSp** points to the [**IO_STACK_LOCATION**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/ns-wdm-_io_stack_location). The driver can use the information that is set in the following members of the IRP and the IRP stack location to process a set security information request:

- **DeviceObject** is a pointer to the target device object.

- **Irp->IoStatus** points to an [**IO_STATUS_BLOCK**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/ns-wdm-_io_status_block) structure that receives the final completion status and information about the requested operation.

- **IrpSp->FileObject** points to the file object that is associated with **DeviceObject**.

  The **IrpSp->FileObject** parameter contains a pointer to the **RelatedFileObject** field, which is also a FILE_OBJECT structure. The **RelatedFileObject** field of the FILE_OBJECT structure isn't valid during the processing of IRP_MJ_SET_SECURITY and shouldn't be used.

- **IrpSp->MajorFunction** is set to IRP_MJ_SET_SECURITY.

- **IrpSp->Parameters.SetSecurity.SecurityDescriptor** points to a [**SECURITY_DESCRIPTOR**](/previous-versions/windows/hardware/drivers/ff556610(v=vs.85)) structure that contains the values of the security information to be assigned to the object.

- **IrpSp->Parameters.SetSecurity.SecurityInformation** is a value of type [**SECURITY_INFORMATION**](security-information.md) that specifies which security information is to be set in the security descriptor, and can be one of the following values.

| SecurityInformation Value | Meaning |
| ------------------------- | ------- |
| DACL_SECURITY_INFORMATION | Indicates that the discretionary access control list (DACL) of the object is being set. Requires WRITE_DAC access. |
| GROUP_SECURITY_INFORMATION | Indicates that the primary group identifier of the object is being set. Requires WRITE_OWNER access. |
| OWNER_SECURITY_INFORMATION | Indicates that the owner identifier of the object is being set. Requires WRITE_OWNER access. |
| SACL_SECURITY_INFORMATION | Indicates that the system ACL (SACL) of the object is being set. Requires ACCESS_SYSTEM_SECURITY access. |
