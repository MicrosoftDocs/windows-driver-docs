# Failing an I/O Operation in a Postoperation Callback Routine

A minifilter driver's [**postoperation callback routine**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/fltkernel/nc-fltkernel-pflt_post_operation_callback) can fail a successful I/O operation, but simply failing an I/O operation does not undo the effect of the operation. The minifilter driver is responsible for performing any processing that is needed to undo the operation.

For example, a minifilter driver's post-create callback routine can fail a successful IRP\_MJ\_CREATE operation by performing the following steps:

1.  Calling [**FltCancelFileOpen**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/fltkernel/nf-fltkernel-fltcancelfileopen) to close the file that was created or opened by the create operation. Note that **FltCancelFileOpen** does not undo any modifications to the file. For example, **FltCancelFileOpen** does not delete a newly created file or restore a truncated file to its previous size.

2.  Setting the callback data structure's **IoStatus.Status** field to the final NTSTATUS value for the operation. This value must be a valid error NTSTATUS value, such as STATUS\_ACCESS\_DENIED.

3.  Setting the callback data structure's **IoStatus.Information** field to zero.

4.  Returning FLT\_POSTOP\_FINISHED\_PROCESSING.

When setting the callback data structure's **IoStatus.Status** field to the final NTSTATUS value for the operation, the minifilter driver must specify a valid error NTSTATUS value. Note that minifilter drivers cannot specify STATUS\_FLT\_DISALLOW\_FAST\_IO; only the filter manager can use this NTSTATUS value.

Callers of [**FltCancelFileOpen**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/fltkernel/nf-fltkernel-fltcancelfileopen) must be running at IRQL &lt;= APC\_LEVEL. However, a minifilter driver can safely call this routine from a post-create callback routine, because, for IRP\_MJ\_CREATE operations, the postoperation callback routine is called at IRQL = PASSIVE\_LEVEL, in the context of the thread that originated the create operation.
