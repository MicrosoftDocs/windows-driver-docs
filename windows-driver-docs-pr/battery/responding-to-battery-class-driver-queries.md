# Responding to Battery Class Driver Queries

The miniclass driver must provide the following three [BatteryMini*Xxx*](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/_battery/) routines, which report battery status:

[*BatteryMiniQueryTag*](/windows/win32/api/batclass/nc-batclass-bclass_query_tag_callback)

[*BatteryMiniQueryInformation*](/windows/win32/api/batclass/nc-batclass-bclass_query_information_callback)

[*BatteryMiniQueryStatus*](/windows/win32/api/batclass/nc-batclass-bclass_query_status_callback)

The [**BatteryClassIoctl**](/windows/win32/api/batclass/nf-batclass-batteryclassioctl) routine in the class driver calls these miniclass driver routines when it receives IOCTLs requesting information about the batteries.
