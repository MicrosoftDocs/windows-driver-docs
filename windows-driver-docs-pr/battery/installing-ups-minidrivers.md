# Installing UPS Minidrivers

UPS minidrivers are user-mode DLLs that can be installed using Microsoft Windows Installer (described in Windows SDK documentation) or an INF file (see [Creating an INF File](../install/overview-of-inf-files.md)).

One responsibility of the installation operation is to create [UPS\\ServiceProviders registry entries](ups-serviceproviders-registry-entries.md).
