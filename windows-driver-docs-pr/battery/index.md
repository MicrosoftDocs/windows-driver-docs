# Battery devices design guide

A battery typically has a pair of drivers: the generic battery class driver provided by Microsoft, and a miniclass driver written specifically for that individual type of battery. The class driver defines the overall functionality of the batteries in the system and interacts with the power manager.

This design guide focuses on:

## Writing battery miniclass drivers

Learn how to write battery miniclass drivers by referring to the [Writing Battery Miniclass Drivers](writing-battery-miniclass-drivers.md) guide.

## Writing UPS minidrivers
